In doing so, we assess whether trading \ninformation adds value to the effectiveness of these strategies. Utilizing variant models of four \ndifferent methodologies, we find strong evidence that supported the Momentum Investment Strategy, \nwhich buys past winner stocks and sells past loser stocks. Our evidence did not support Contrarian \nInvestment Strategy, which posits that investors overreact to good and bad news. Our winners\u2019 \nportfolios outperform our losers\u2019 portfolios. The Negative Volume Effect Strategy did not work, \nwhich is contrary to the Foerster, Prihar and Schmitz (1995) study. We found that winners\u2019 stocks \ndid not reverse in cases of heavy volume; nor did loser stocks reverse in a high volume context. \nHowever, we did find that trading information has an impact on stock returns and thus adds value to \ninvestment strategies for the 1990 to 2000 investment period. Investors who combine past price and \ntrading volume information in constructing their investment strategies would achieve higher returns \nthan investors who base their portfolio construction decisions solely on stock prices. \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nince the dawn of modern finance, there has been a long debate and research on whether historical data on \nstocks is useful information in forecasting stock price changes. According to the weak form of the \nEfficient Market Hypothesis, it is impossible to forecast market direction based on past data. Nevertheless, \nmany researchers, DeBondt and Thaler (1985), Jegadeesh and Titman (1993), Assogbavi, Khoury, and Yourougou \n(1995) Baytas and Nusret (1999), Dirk, DeBondt and Weber (1999), Mun, Vasconcellos, and Kish (2000), have \nchallenged this hypothesis by showing that investors can achieve abnormal returns using investment strategies based \non past market data such as price and trading volume. Recent findings by Chordia and Swaminathan (2000), and \nGervais, Kaniel and Mingelgrin (2001), on investment strategies based on historical data tend to confirm that past \nstock price and trading volume provide valuable information in predicting market direction and stock returns. \nAccordingly, practitioners should consider using past market information in constructing investment portfolios. \nHowever, depending on the strategy, the methodology utilized may seem at times to be contradictory. For instance, \nwhile contrarian investment strategies recommend buying past losers and selling past winners, momentum strategies \nrecommend buying past winners and selling past losers. From a practitioner standpoint, knowing which of these \ninvestment strategies to apply becomes very challenging.  The main objective of this paper, is to investigate different \nstrategies based upon previous studies such as those by DeBondt and Thaler (1985, contrarian), Jegadeesh and Titman \n(1993, momentum), Conrad, Hameed, and Niden (1994, negative volume effect), and Gervais, Kaniel and Mingelgrin \n(2001, positive volume effect), as well as to provide a better understanding of utilizing these strategies on the \nCanadian stock market using the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) 100. Additionally, the extent to which trading \ninformation adds value to the robustness of these investment strategies is assessed. \n \n                         \n1 The authors acknowledge research support from CISRO Institute of Management at Laurentian University. \nS \nInternational Business & Economics Research Journal \u2013 September 2005                 Volume 4, Number 9 \n \n28 \nThe remainder of the paper is as follows: Section II presents a brief review of the literature; in Section III the \ndata and methodologies are described; Section IV summarizes results and Section V indicates our conclusions. \n \nLITERATURE REVIEW \n \nThere are many published studies on contrarian/momentum investment strategies. The earliest and most \ninfluential work on contrarian investment strategy was done by DeBondt and Thaler (1985), who found that when \nU.S. stocks were ranked on their returns over the past three to five years, those with the lowest past returns earn higher \nreturns over the subsequent three to five years, and vice versa. Baytas and Nusret (1999) reported that long-term \ncontrarian strategies in the other seven industrialized countries seem to have significant returns. Dirk, DeBondt and \nWeber (1999) found that contrarian strategies in Germany appear to be profitable. Mun, Vasconcellos, and Kish \n(2000) tested contrarian strategies in the U.S. and Canadian markets over the period of 1986 to 1996. Their results \nalso show that the contrarian returns in this period were less significant in Canada than in the U.S.  \n \nAs far as momentum investment strategy is concerned, one of the earliest studies done by Jegadeesh and \nTitman (1993) on the NYSE and the AMEX reported that a momentum strategy that buys the last 12 month top \nperformer stocks and keeps them for just 3 months can earn as much as 1.49% per month. Cleary and Inglis (1998) \nalso support the momentum strategy with a study based on Canadian common stocks during the period of 1978-1990. \nRouwenhorst (1998) shows that momentum strategies worked in twelve European countries. Rouwenhorst (1999) also \nreported also emerging market stocks exhibited momentum. Dirk, De Bondt, and Weber (1999) reported that \nmomentum and contrarian strategies appeared to beat a passive approach that invested in the market index of all major \ncompanies listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange of Germany for the 1961-1991 period. Chan, Hameed, and Tong \n(2000) showed statistically significant evidence of momentum profits derived from international stock market indices. \nAssogbavi and Dodge (2002) found that a momentum strategy that invested in medium-horizon \u201cWinners\u201d and sold \npast \u201cLosers\u201d gained approximately 2 percent per month in the Nigeria Stock Exchange.  \n \nWith respect to trading volume, Campbell, Grossman, and Wang (1993) suggested that the first-order daily \nreturn autocorrelation tended to decline with volume. Blume, Easley, and O\u2019Hara (1994) indicated that volume \nprovided insights about information quality which could not be deduced from price statistics. Conrad, Hameed, and \nNiden (1994) presented strong evidence of a relationship between trading activity and subsequent autocovariances in \nweekly returns. Specifically, high-transaction securities experienced price reversal, while the returns of low-\ntransaction securities were positively autocovarying. Assogbavi, Khoury, and Yourougou (1995) confirmed an \nasymmetry in the price-volume relationship in equity markets using Canadian data. Datar, Vinay, Naik and Radcliffe \n(1998) pointed out that low turnover stocks generally earn higher returns than high turnover stocks. Chordia and \nSwaminathan (2000) reported that daily and weekly returns on high volume portfolios led returns on low volume \nportfolios because returns on low volume portfolios responded more slowly to information about market returns. Lee \nand Swaminathan (2000) asserted that firms with high (low) past turnover ratios earn lower (higher) future returns, \nand have consistently more negative (positive) earnings surprises over next eight quarters. Price momentum effects \nreverse over the next five years, and high (low) volume winners (losers) experience faster reversals. Gervais, Kaniel \nand Mingelgrin (2001) suggested that stocks experiencing unusually high (low) trading volume over a day or a week \ntended to appreciate (depreciate) over the course of the following month. The common ground of all of these studies is \nthat past information is invaluable for predicting future market trends and individual stock returns. The purpose of this \nstudy is to analyze the performance of a set of investment strategies based upon past market information, from the \nCanadian stock market (the TSE). In doing so, the importance of trading information in these investment strategies for \nthe investment period of 1990 to 2000 is established. \n \nDATA AND METODOLOGY \n \nData Description \n \nThe data used in this study consists of daily trading volumes and prices from January 1990 to February 2000 \non 100 stocks that made up the TSE 100 index. The TSE 100 Index includes 100 of the largest and most liquid stocks \ntraded on the TSE. It represents two-thirds of the capitalization of the Canadian equity market. The TSE is the \nInternational Business & Economics Research Journal \u2013 September 2005                 Volume 4, Number 9 \n \n29 \nCanada's premier market for senior equities, accounting for approximately 95% of all equity trading in Canada. In \n2000, more than 40 billion shares valued at $944 billion were traded. \n \nMethodology \n \nFor comparison purposes, the methodologies used in this paper to evaluate the performance of \ncontrarian/momentum investment strategies are adapted from previous articles on similar subjects with minor \nmodifications. Specifically, our methodologies are based on four different articles; DeBondt and Thaler (1985) for the \nContrarian strategy; Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) for the Momentum strategy; Conrad, Hameed, and Niden (1994) for \nthe Negative volume effect; and Gervais, Kaniel and Mingelgrin (2001) for the Positive volume effect. In these four \nanalyses, the original ideas and approaches are followed as closely as possible. \n \nANALYSES AND RESULTS \n \nContrarian Strategy \n \nThe Contrarian Strategy is related to the overreaction hypothesis which assumes that most people tend to \n\u201coverreact\u201d to unexpected and dramatic news events. Some economists such as Basu (1977) and Dreman (1982) \nbelieve that the same behavior occurs in stock markets. In other words, they think that stock prices are overvalued in \ncase of good news and undervalued in case of bad news, but eventually return to more appropriate, less inflated or less \ndeflated values. Based on this hypothesis, DeBondt and Thaler (1985) designed an empirical test due to the fact that: \n(1) Extreme movements in stock prices will be followed by subsequent price movements in the opposite direction. (2) \nThe more extreme the initial price movement, the greater will be the subsequent adjustment. We follow DeBondt and \nThaler\u2019s (1985) empirical test design that bought past losers and sold past winners. Our empirical test results, after \ncorrecting for missing data problems and for the time frame of this study, are presented in Table I. \n \nWinner portfolios were composed of top 10% stocks in terms of returns in formation periods. Loser \nportfolios were composed of bottom 10% stocks in terms of returns in formation periods. The returns of winner \nportfolios and loser portfolios were calculated over three year holding periods following a three year formation period. \nAverage annual return is calculated by dividing Average Return for three years of the holding period by three. \n \nFor every stock j, starting in December 1992 (month 36; the \"portfolio formation date\", we compute the \ncumulative returns Rjt for the prior 36 months or three-year period (the \"portfolio formation\" period, months 1 through \n36). Rjt is calculated as below; \n \n \nwhere Rjt = cumulative return in a given stock j for the tth formation period of three-year duration starting in January \n1990; PjtF = the price of a given stock j on the first day of the tth formation period; PjtL = the price of a given stock j on \nthe last day of the tth formation period. \n \nThen we rank the top decile as the winner portfolio and the bottom decile as the loser portfolio. The \nportfolios are then formed based on the ranking prior to t = 0, the portfolio formation date. For both winner and loser \nportfolios in the subsequent three-year test period (month 37 through month 72), we compute the cumulative average \nreturns of all securities in the portfolio. Similar computation is done for subsequent periods ending in December 1993, \n1994, 1995, and 1996. In Panel A, X is the annual average return (in percent) of portfolios, and Sx is the sample \nstandard deviation in percentage terms. Panel B shows the annual return for winner and loser portfolios for five \noverlapping periods. \n \njtF\njtF\njtL\njt\nP\nP\nP\nR\n\uf02d\n\uf03d\nInternational Business & Economics Research Journal \u2013 September 2005                 Volume 4, Number 9 \n \n30 \nTable I.

Our findings presented on Table I indicate that \nthe returns of winner portfolios are higher than those of loser portfolios except for the test period of 1996 to 1998. On \naverage, for the periods of 1993 to 1999, winner portfolios achieved 66.72 % annual return (t-statistic = 3.29) and \nloser portfolios achieved 40.12 % annual return (t-statistic = 6.34). Both values are statistically significant. Therefore, \nit seems that contrarian strategy did not work for 1990s\u2019 TSE 100 stocks counter to the belief that loser portfolios are \nsupposed to outperform winner portfolios according to the overreaction hypothesis or contrarian strategy.  A possible \nexplanation of the failure of contrarian strategy may be related to the fact that Canadian stock market was a bull \nmarket in the 1990\u2019s. Average annual market return for TSE 100 between 1993 and 1999 was 24.79 %. However, \nloser portfolios still outperformed the market return by over 15%. Therefore, one cannot say contrarian strategy totally \nfailed for this period. \n \nMomentum Strategy (Or Relative Strength Strategy) \n \nThe momentum investment strategy is based on the assumption that stocks under-react to arrival of new \ninformation as opposed to the contrarian strategy. It suggests that one buy past winners and sell past losers. The \napproach used in this study is a variant of what Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) used in their study. Our empirical test \nresults are presented in Table II. The results correct for missing data and the time frame. \n \nFor every stock j, starting in December 1990 (month 12; the \"portfolio formation date\"), we compute the \ncumulative returns Rjt for the prior 12 months or one-year period (the \"portfolio formation\" period, months 1 through \n12). Divergent to the contrarian, the momentum strategy buys the winners (top decile portfolio) and sells the losers \n(bottom decile portfolio). Next, the return for each portfolio in the subsequent one-quarter test period (month 13 \nthrough month 15) is computed. The process is then repeated throughout December 1999 to generate 12-month \nformation and 3-month holding period momentum portfolio. Winner portfolios were composed of top 10% stocks in \nterms of returns during formation periods of one year. Loser portfolios were composed of bottom 10% stocks in terms \nof returns during formation periods of one year. The returns of winner portfolios and loser portfolios were calculated \nover subsequent three months or a quarter of holding periods. \n \nThe annual return for each year was compounded from quarterly returns using the following equation: \n \nAnnual Return = ((1+Q1/100)*(1+Q2/100)*(1+Q3/100)*(1+Q4/100)-1)*100 \n \nTable II below presents our major findings. In Panel A, X is the annual average return (in percent) for each \nportfolio, and Sx is the sample standard deviation in percentage terms. Panel B shows returns for loser and winner \nportfolio for each year. \n \n                         \n2 The \u201cC\u201d computer program developed to generate these results is available from the authors on request. \nInternational Business & Economics Research Journal \u2013 September 2005                 Volume 4, Number 9 \n \n31 \n \nThe results are quite consistent with what Jegadeesh and Titman (1993) reported for U.S. market and what \nFoerster et al (1995) did with the Canadian market for 1977 to 1992. For the quarterly returns, winner portfolios \noutperformed loser portfolios 27 quarters out of 36 quarters for the nine-year period between 1991 and 1999. Winners \nshowed a 75 % winning rate over losers. For the annual returns, winner portfolios always outperformed loser \nportfolios for the same period. \n \n \nTable II.

The performance of this strategy is quite \nsubstantial from 1990 to 2000, which was a boom period for the Canadian market. \n \n \nPositive Volume Effect Strategy (High Volume Return Premium) \n \nThis strategy uses trading volume as an exclusive predictor of future prices. Using this approach, Gervais, \nKaniel, and Mingelgrin (2001) reported that individual stocks whose trading activity is unusually large (small) over \nperiods of a day or a week, as measured by trading volume during those periods, tend to experience large (small) \nreturns over the subsequent month. They postulated that this result is due to shocks in trader interest in a given stock, \nthat is, the stock\u2019s visibility. Following Gervais, Kaniel, and Mingelgrin (2001), we construct our methodology and \nconduct our analysis as follows. First, we construct our sample by splitting the period between January 1990 to \nDecember 1999 into 51 nonintersecting trading intervals of 50 trading days. The first interval is used only for \nformation and reference purpose. Each formation period of 50-days trading interval is split into a reference period and \na formation date, which, respectively, consists of the first 49 days and the last day of the interval. The number of \nshares traded is used as the measure of trading volume. For a given formation period, a stock is classified as a high- \n(low-) volume stock if its formation date volume is among the top 10 percent (bottom 10 percent) of 50 daily trading \nvolumes. Otherwise, it is classified as a normal volume stock. At the formation date, we form high- (low) volume \nportfolios based on the stock's trading volume classification. After the portfolios are formed, they are held without \nInternational Business & Economics Research Journal \u2013 September 2005                 Volume 4, Number 9 \n \n32 \nany rebalancing over the next 50-days trading interval which is the holding or the test period3.  The average returns \nfor both portfolios in a given test period, Xp is computed as below; \n \n \nWhere Np = the number of stocks in the high volume portfolio (p = H) or the low volume portfolio (p = L); PjF = the \nprice of a given stock j on the first day of the test period in the high volume portfolio or the low volume portfolio; PjL \n= the price of a given stock j on the Last day of the test period in the high volume portfolio or the low volume \nportfolio. The periodic returns of high portfolios and low portfolios were calculated over subsequent holding period of \n50 trading days. \n \nThe annual return for each year was compounded from periodic returns using the following equation;  \n \nAnnual Return = ((1+P1/100)*(1+P2/100)*(1+P3/100)*(1+P4/100)*(1+P5/100)-1)*100 \n \nThe findings are presented in Table III below. In Panel A, X is the annual average return (in percent) of each \nportfolio, and Sx is the sample standard deviation in percentage terms. Panel B shows returns for High and Low \nportfolio for each year. \n \nOur results in Table III show that the periods of extremely high volume tend to be followed by positive \nexcess returns, while periods of extremely low volume tend to be followed by even larger positive excess returns in \n1990 \u2013 2000 periods for TSE 100 stocks. The average annual return for high volume stocks, 24.27% (significant at t = \n3.087) is higher than the market return of 19.69 % but the average annual return for low volume stocks, 35.83 % \n(significant at t = 3.236) is even higher than that of high volume stocks. For the investment periods considered, high \nvolume stocks outperform low volume stocks only in 24 periods out of total 50 periods tested. For individual years, \nthe results of only two years, 1990 and 1992, were consistent with the findings of Gervais, Kaniel, and Mingelgrin \n(2001) on the NYSE that show that high volume tend to be followed by positive excess returns, whereas periods of \nlow volume tend to be followed by negative excess returns. However, an interesting point is that average annual \nreturn of high volume stocks, 24.27 % is still higher than that of the market, 19.69 %. \n \nNegative Volume Effect \n \nOne important implication of the paper of Campbell, Grossman, and Wang (1993) is that \u201cprice change \naccompanied by high volume tend to be reversed; this will be less true of price changes on days with low volume.\u201d \nConrad, Hameed, and Niden (1994) tried to test for this relation between lagged volume and price suggested by \nCampbell, Grossman, and Wang (1993) using a strategy varied from what Lehmann (1990) proposed. Following \nConrad, Hameed, and Niden (1994), the methodology used in this analysis is as follows. For each week (week t), we \ncalculate uit-1, the measure of abnormal trading in security i at week t-1 or previous week as follow: \n \nuit-1 = (Vit-1 \u2013 V it-2) / Vit-2 \n \nwhere Vit-1 and Vit-2 are the sums of the trading volumes in security i for week t-1 and t-2, respectively. A positive uit-1 \nis considered a positive trading shock or high-transaction security; a negative uit-1 is taken as a negative trading shock \nor low-transaction security4.

Weekly return for each year is the average weekly \nreturn for the year. Annual return for each year is compounded from weekly return using the following equations; \n \nAnnual Return = (Weekly Return/100+1)**52*100-100 \n \nThe results of our analysis appear in Table IV below. Our findings are partly consistent with Conrad, \nHameed, and Niden (1994) who demonstrated that high-transaction securities experience price reversals whereas low \ntransactions securities experience price continuation using NASDAQ and NMS data. In this study, winners keep \nwinning and losers keep losing regardless of trading volumes. In other words, our results show price continuation \nwithout regard to transaction levels. On the contrary, in the study of Conrad et al. (1994), the price continuation occurs \nonly with low transaction securities. That is, low transaction winners keep winning and low transaction losers keep \nlosing but high transaction winners experience losing and high transaction losers experience winning. However, in our \nstudy, winners with high transaction always outperformed winners with low transaction and losers with high \ntransaction most of time are out performed by losers with low transaction. Therefore, trading information on the TSE \n100 still appears to be an important predictor of the returns of individual securities. \n \n \nTable IV.

However, high transactions always outperformed low transactions with significant \ndifferences. So, we conclude that information on trading activities appears to be an important factor in the TSE 100. \nFor loser portfolios, we observe something similar. Most of the time losers continued to lose or their profits were \nsignificantly lower than market returns, if any. So, losers were always outperformed by market returns.  As far as the \nInternational Business & Economics Research Journal \u2013 September 2005                 Volume 4, Number 9 \n \n35 \naverage annual returns, WH (winners with high transaction) portfolios and WL (winners with low transaction) \nportfolios achieved an astonishing return of 175.37 % per year (significant at t = 10.077) and \u201cmoderate\u201d-but-\u201cstill-\nsignificant\u201d returns of 60.29 % per year (significant at t = 5.737), respectively. If we see losers, both LH (losers with \nhigh transaction) portfolios and LL (losers with low transaction) portfolios suffered the negative earnings of \u201328.31 % \n(significant at t = -5.487) and \u201312.15 % per year (not significant at t = -1.771), respectively. This finding is somewhat \nconsistent with that of momentum strategy that buys past winners and sells past losers. As in momentum strategy, past \nwinners continued to win and past losers continued to lose in a subsequent period. However, in this strategy past \ntrading information combined with past returns seems to generate even more returns than the momentum strategy \ndoes. \n \nThe negative aspect of this strategy is the frequent portfolio rebalancing activities and accompanying \nincrease in transaction costs. In this strategy, the portfolio is rebalanced every week. Therefore, accumulated \ntransaction cost can be significant. These days however, due to the presence of discount dealers and steep competition \nin the transaction market, it is possible for even a nonprofessional to keep transaction cost down to less than 1% a \nweek with a moderate amount of investment. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThis study attempts to produce a better understanding of investment strategies based on past market \ninformation. It shows that aside form the momentum strategy that buys past winners and sells past losers, no other \ninvestment strategy investigated is consistent with findings in the U.S. market using the same strategies. While the \nNegative Volume Effect shows the importance of trading volume in constructing investment portfolios, our findings \non the impact of such volume information are quite different from those documented by Conrad, Hameed and Niden \n(1994) in the U.S..  While Conrad et al. (1994) show that high-volume stocks experience price reversal whereas low \nvolume stocks experience price continuation, this study shows a presence of price continuation for both low and high \nvolume and that high volume winners always outperform low volume winners and low volume losers outperform high \nvolume losers. The main conclusion of this study is that, investors who were long in past winners and short in past \nlosers would consistently achieve above market return for the period of 1990 to 2000. These findings are consistent \nwith results of a previous study conducted by Foerster, Prihar and Schmitz (1995) for the period 1977-1992. The \nmomentum effect seems to be a characteristic of the Canadian market which is evidence of price continuation in this \nmarket. The robustness of the price continuation hypothesis within this market and the information content of trading \nvolumes could be related to the nature and the importance of this market as compared to the U.S. market.  \n \nREFERENCES \n \n1. \nAssogbavi, T. and J.
