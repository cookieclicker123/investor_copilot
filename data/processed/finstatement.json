This suspicion runs \neven deeper when values are is estimated for an asset based upon \nexpected future cash \ufb02ows. \t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f A Preference for under estimating value rather than over estimating it: \nWhen there is more than one approach to valuing an asset, accounting \nconvention takes the view that the more conservative (lower) estimate \nof value should be used rather than the less conservative (higher) \nestimate of value. \t\n\r\nAswath Damodaran!\n6!\nMeasuring asset value!\n\uf06e\u202f Since accounting statements, at least as structured now, begin with the \nhistorical cost at which assets were acquired and \ufb01nancing raised, they \nare no designed to measure the current value of assets.\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f The only assets that are reported at or close to market value, at most \ncompanies today, are current assets. There are a handful of sectors \n(such as banks) where assets are marked up to market.\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f As a consequence, the liabilities and the shareholders\u2019 equity from an \naccounting statement are not measures of the current values of either.\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Fair value accounting, a trend in both US and international accounting, \naims to bring asset values in accounting balance sheets closer to their \ncurrent market values.\t\n\r\nAswath Damodaran!\n7!\nA Financial Balance Sheet!\nAssets\nLiabilities\nAssets in Place\nDebt\nEquity\nFixed Claim on cash flows\nLittle or No role in management\nFixed Maturity\nTax Deductible\nResidual Claim on cash flows\nSignificant Role in management\nPerpetual Lives\nGrowth Assets\nExisting Investments\nGenerate cashflows today\nIncludes long lived (fixed) and \nshort-lived(working \ncapital) assets\nExpected Value that will be \ncreated by future investments\nAswath Damodaran!\n8!\nThe Income Statement!\nFigure 4.2: Income Statement\nRevenues\nGross revenues from sale \nof products or services\n- Operating Expenses\nExpenses associates with\ngenerating revenues\n= Operating Income\nOperating income for the\nperiod\n- Financial Expenses\nExpenses associated with\nborrowing and other financing\n- Taxes\nTaxes due on taxable income\n= Net Income before extraordinary items\nEarnings to Common & \nPreferred Equity for\nCurrent Period\n- (+) Extraordinary Losses (Profits)\nProfits and Losses not\nassociated with operations\n- Income Changes Associated with Accounting Changes\nProfits or losses associated\nwith changes in accounting\nrules\n- Preferred Dividends\nDividends paid to preferred\nstockholders\n= Net Income to Common Stockholders\nAswath Damodaran!\n9!\nPrinciples underlying accounting income \nstatements!\n\uf06e\u202f Accrual accounting: In accrual accounting, the revenue from selling a \ngood or service is recognized in the period in which the good is sold or \nthe service is performed (in whole or substantially). A corresponding \neffort is made on the expense side to match expenses to revenues.\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Expenses are categorized into operating, \ufb01nancing and capital \nexpenses. \t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Operating expenses are expenses that, at least in theory, provide bene\ufb01ts \nonly for the current period; the cost of labor and materials expended to \ncreate products that are sold in the current period is a good example.\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Financing expenses are expenses arising from the non-equity \ufb01nancing \nused to raise capital for the business; the most common example is interest \nexpenses. \t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Capital expenses are expenses that are expected to generate bene\ufb01ts over \nmultiple periods; for instance, the cost of buying land and buildings is \ntreated as a capital expense. \t\n\r\nAswath Damodaran!\n10!\nMeasuring accounting pro\ufb01tability!\n\uf06e\u202f Pro\ufb01t relative to investment: By scaling pro\ufb01ts to the capital invested \nin an asset or business, you get accounting returns. It can take these \nforms:\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Return on equity = Net Income/ Book Value of Equity\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Pre-tax Return on (invested) capital = Operating Income/ (Book Value of \nEquity + Book Value of Debt \u2013 Cash)\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Pro\ufb01t, relative to revenues: By scaling pro\ufb01ts to revenues, you can \narrive at pro\ufb01t margins. Again, it can take two forms:\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Net Margin = Net Pro\ufb01t/ Revenues\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Operating Margin = Operating Income/ Revenues\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Both return on capital and operating margin can also be computed in \nafter-tax terms, by multiplying each by (1- tax rate)\t\n\r\nAswath Damodaran!\n11!\nMeasuring \ufb01nancial leverage!\n\uf06e\u202f Debt, relative to equity and capital: The debt due in a business can be \nscaled to either the equity in the business or the total capital (debt plus \nequity).\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Debt/ Equity Ratio = Debt/ Equity\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Debt/Capital Ratio = Debt/ (Debt + Equity\t\n\r\nBoth ratios can be computed in book value or market value terms.\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Debt obligations, relative to cash \ufb02ows and earnings: The \ufb01nancial \nleverage burden can also be stated in terms of total debt or debt \npayments each period:\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Debt/EBITDA = Debt/ EBITDA\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Interest coverage ratio = Operating Income/ Interest Expenses\t\n\r\nAswath Damodaran!\n12!\nAccounting inconsistencies\u2026!\n\uf06e\u202f There are a few expenses that consistently are miscategorized in \n\ufb01nancial statements.In particular,\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Operating leases are considered as operating expenses by accountants but \nthey are really \ufb01nancial expenses\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f R &D expenses are considered as operating expenses by accountants but \nthey are really capital expenses.\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f The degree of discretion granted to \ufb01rms on revenue recognition and \nextraordinary items is used to manage earnings and provide misleading \npictures of pro\ufb01tability.\t\n\r\nAswath Damodaran!\n13!\nDealing with Operating Lease Expenses!\n\uf06e\u202f Debt Value of Operating Leases = PV of Operating Lease Expenses at \nthe pre-tax cost of debt\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f This now creates an asset - the value of which is equal to the debt \nvalue of operating leases. This asset now has to be depreciated over \ntime.\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Finally, the operating earnings has to be adjusted to re\ufb02ect these \nchanges:\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Adjusted Operating Earnings = Operating Earnings + Operating Lease \nExpense - Depreciation on the leased asset\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f If we assume that depreciation = principal payment on the debt value of \noperating leases, we can use a short cut:\t\n\r\nAdjusted Operating Earnings = Operating Earnings + Debt value of \nOperating leases * Cost of debt\t\n\r\nAswath Damodaran!\n14!\nThe Effects of Capitalizing Operating Leases!\n\uf06e\u202f Debt : will increase, leading to an increase in debt ratios used in the \ncost of capital and levered beta calculation\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Operating income: will increase, since operating leases will now be \nbefore the imputed interest on the operating lease expense\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Net income: will be unaffected since it is after both operating and \n\ufb01nancial expenses anyway\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Return on Capital will generally decrease since the increase in \noperating income will be proportionately lower than the increase in \nbook capital invested\t\n\r\nAswath Damodaran!\n15!\nR&D Expenses: Operating or Capital Expenses!\n\uf06e\u202f Accounting standards require us to consider R&D as an operating \nexpense even though it is designed to generate future growth. It is \nmore logical to treat it as capital expenditures.\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f To capitalize R&D,\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Specify an amortizable life for R&D (2 - 10 years)\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Collect past R&D expenses for as long as the amortizable life\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f Sum up the unamortized R&D over the period. (Thus, if the amortizable \nlife is 5 years, the research asset can be obtained by adding up 1/5th of the \nR&D expense from \ufb01ve years ago, 2/5th of the R&D expense from four \nyears ago...:\t\n\r\nAswath Damodaran!\n16!\nThe Effect of Capitalizing R&D!\n\uf06e\u202f Operating Income will generally increase, though it depends upon \nwhether R&D is growing or not. If it is \ufb02at, there will be no effect \nsince the amortization will offset the R&D added back. The faster \nR&D is growing the more operating income will be affected.\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Net income will increase proportionately, depending again upon how \nfast R&D is growing\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Book value of equity (and capital) will increase by the capitalized \nResearch asset\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f Capital expenditures will increase by the amount of R&D; \nDepreciation will increase by the amortization of the research asset; \nFor all \ufb01rms, the net cap ex will increase by the same amount as the \nafter-tax operating income.\t\n\r\nAswath Damodaran!\n17!\nThe Statement of Cash Flows!\nCash Flows From Operations\n+ Cash Flows From Investing\n+ Cash Flows from Financing\nNet cash flow from operations,\nafter taxes and interest expenses\nIncludes divestiture and acquisition\nof real assets (capital expenditures)\nand disposal and purchase of \nfinancial assets. Also includes \nacquisitions of other firms.\nNet cash flow from the issue and\nrepurchase of equity, from the\nissue and repayment of debt and after\ndividend payments\n= Net Change in Cash Balance\nFigure 4.3: Statement of Cash Flows\nAswath Damodaran!\n18!\nValuation cash \ufb02ows!\n\uf06e\u202f In valuation, the cash \ufb02ows that we compute can either be free cash \n\ufb02ows to equity or free cash \ufb02ows to all capital investors.\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f The free cash \ufb02ow to equity is the cash left over, after you have made \ninterest expenses, paid taxes and met reinvestment needs. It is also after \nthe net cash \ufb02ow from issuing debt (positive) and repaying debt \n(negative)\t\n\r\n\u2022\u202f The free cash \ufb02ow to the \ufb01rm is a pre-debt cash \ufb02ow, but it is after taxes \n(a hypothetical tax that you would have paid if you had no debt) and \nreinvestment needs.\t\n\r\n\uf06e\u202f The statement of cash \ufb02ows starts with net income (which makes it \ncloser to a cash \ufb02ow to equity) but it also incorporates cash \ufb02ows from \nnew equity issues and to equity investors (dividends and stock \nbuybacks).\t\n\r\n", "metadata": {"title": "finstatement.ppt", "author": "Aswath Damodaran", "creation_date": "D:20120627210041Z00'00'", "source_file": "finstatement.pdf"}}
