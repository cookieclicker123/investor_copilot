FactSet Geographic Revenue Exposure data (based on the most recently reported fiscal year data for \neach company in the index) was used to answer this question. For this analysis, the index was divided into two groups: \ncompanies that generate more than 50% of sales inside the U.S. (more domestic exposure) and companies that generate \nmore than 50% of sales outside the U.S. (more international exposure). Aggregate earnings and revenue growth rates \nwere then calculated based on these two groups. \nThe blended (combines actual results for companies that have reported and estimated results for companies that have yet \nto report) earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 for Q3 2024 is 5.4%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales \ninside the U.S., the blended earnings growth rate is 1.5%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales outside \nthe U.S., the blended earnings growth rate is 12.9%. \nThe blended revenue growth rate for the S&P 500 for Q3 2024 is 5.5%. For companies that generate more than 50% of \nsales inside the U.S., the blended revenue growth rate is 5.3%. For companies that generate more than 50% of sales \noutside the U.S., the blended revenue growth rate is 6.1%. \nWhat is driving the outperformance of S&P 500 companies with higher international revenue exposure? At the company \nlevel, NVIDIA, Pfizer, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms are 4 of the top 6 contributors to earnings and revenue growth for S&P \n500 companies with more international revenue exposure. Three of these four companies are \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d companies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 FactSet Research Systems Inc.

Relative to estimates, both \nthe number and magnitude of positive earnings surprises are below their 5-year averages. However, the index is reporting \nhigher earnings for Q3 relative to the end of the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, the index is reporting earnings growth \nfor the fifth-straight quarter. \nOverall, 93% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported actual results for Q3 2024 to date. Of these companies, 75% \nhave reported actual EPS above estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 77% but equal to the 10-year average of \n75%. In aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 4.3% above estimates, which is below the 5-year average \nof 8.5% and below the 10-year average of 6.8%. Historical averages reflect actual results from all 500 companies, not the \nactual results from the percentage of companies that have reported through this point in time. \nSince September 30, positive EPS surprises reported by companies in the Financials, Communication Services, and \nConsumer Discretionary sectors, partially offset by negative EPS surprises reported by companies in the Information \nTechnology sector, have been the largest contributors to the increase in the overall earnings growth rate for the index over \nthis period. \nAs a result, the index is reporting higher earnings for the third quarter today relative to the end of the quarter. The blended \n(combines actual results for companies that have reported and estimated results for companies that have yet to report) \nearnings growth rate for the third quarter is 5.4% today, compared to an earnings growth rate of 4.2% at the end of the \nthird quarter (September 30). \nIf 5.4% is the actual growth rate for the quarter, it will mark the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth \nfor the index. \nSeven of the eleven sectors are reporting (or have reported) year-over-year growth, led by the Communication Services \nand Health Care sectors. On the other hand, four sectors are reporting (or have reported) a year-over-year decline in \nearnings, led by the Energy and Materials sectors. \nIn terms of revenues, 61% of S&P 500 companies have reported actual revenues above estimates, which is below the 5-\nyear average of 69% and below the 10-year average of 64%. In aggregate, companies are reporting revenues that are \n1.2% above the estimates, which is below the 5-year average of 2.0% and below the 10-year average of 1.4%. Again, \nhistorical averages reflect actual results from all 500 companies, not the actual results from the percentage of companies \nthat have reported through this point in time. \nSince September 30, positive revenue surprises reported by companies in the Health Care sector, partially offset by \ndownward revisions to revenue estimates and negative revenue surprises for companies in the Energy sector, have been \nthe largest contributors to the increase in the overall revenue growth rate for the index over this period. \nAs a result, the blended revenue growth rate for the third quarter is 5.5% today, compared to a revenue growth rate of \n4.7% at the end of the third quarter (September 30). \nIf 5.5% is the actual revenue growth rate for the quarter, it will mark the 16th consecutive quarter of revenue growth for the \nindex. It will also mark the highest revenue growth rate reported by the index since Q3 2022 (11.0%). \nNine sectors are reporting (or have reported) year-over-year growth in revenues, led by the Information Technology, Health \nCare, and Communication Services sectors. On the other hand, two sectors are reporting (or have reported) a year-over-\nyear decline in revenues, led by the Energy sector. \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 FactSet Research Systems Inc. All rights reserved.  \nFactSet Research Systems Inc.  www.factset.com \n \n \n6\nEARNINGS INSIGHT \nLooking ahead, analysts expect (year-over-year) earnings growth rates of 12.1%, 12.7%, and 12.0% for Q4 2024, Q1 \n2025, and Q2 2025, respectively. For CY 2024, analysts are calling for (year-over-year) earnings growth of 9.3%. For CY \n2025, analysts are predicting (year-over-year) earnings growth of 15.0%. \nThe forward 12-month P/E ratio is 22.0, which is above the 5-year average (19.6) and above the 10-year average (18.1). \nThis P/E ratio is also above the forward P/E ratio of 21.6 recorded at the end of the third quarter (September 30). \nDuring the upcoming week, 14 S&P 500 companies (including 1 Dow 30 component) are scheduled to report results for \nthe third quarter. \nScorecard: Percentage of Positive EPS Surprises Is Below 5-Year Average \nPercentage of Companies Beating EPS Estimates (75%) is Below 5-Year Average \nOverall, 93% of the companies in the S&P 500 have reported earnings to date for the third quarter. Of these companies, \n75% have reported actual EPS above the mean EPS estimate, 5% have reported actual EPS equal to the mean EPS \nestimate, and 20% have reported actual EPS below the mean EPS estimate. The percentage of companies reporting EPS \nabove the mean EPS estimate is below the 1-year average (78%) and below the 5-year average (77%), but equal to the \n10-year average (75%). Historical averages reflect actual results from all 500 companies, not the actual results from the \npercentage of companies that have reported through this point in time. \nAt the sector level, the Communication Services (95%) sector has the highest percentage of companies reporting earnings \nabove estimates, while the Materials (50%) sector has the lowest percentage of companies reporting earnings above \nestimates. \nEarnings Surprise Percentage (+4.3%) is Below 5-Year Average \nIn aggregate, companies are reporting earnings that are 4.3% above expectations. This surprise percentage is below the \n1-year average (+5.5%), below the 5-year average (+8.5%), and below the 10-year average (+6.8%). Historical averages \nreflect actual results from all 500 companies, not the actual results from the percentage of companies that have reported \nthrough this point in time. \nThe Communication Services (+11.8%) sector reported the largest positive (aggregate) difference between actual earnings \nand estimated earnings.

Within this sector, Apple ($0.97 vs. $1.60) and Intel (-$0.46 vs. -$0.02) \nhave reported the largest negative EPS surprises. The actual (GAAP) EPS for Apple of $0.97 included a net charge of \n$10.2 billion related to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court\u2019s State Aid decision. The majority of \nanalysts provided EPS estimates for Apple on a GAAP basis. The (non-GAAP) EPS actual for Intel of -$0.46 included \nimpairment charges of $3.1 billion. \nThe Materials (-7.0%) sector reported the second-largest negative (aggregate) difference between actual earnings and \nestimated earnings.

This percentage increase is above the 5-\nyear average price increase of +1.0% during this same window for companies reporting positive earnings surprises. \nCompanies that have reported negative earnings surprises for Q3 2024 have seen an average price decrease of -2.9% \ntwo days before the earnings release through two days after the earnings. This percentage decrease is larger than the 5-\nyear average price decrease of -2.3% during this same window for companies reporting negative earnings surprises. \nPercentage of Companies Beating Revenue Estimates (61%) is Below 5-Year Average \nIn terms of revenues, 61% of the companies have reported actual revenues above estimated revenues, 0% of the \ncompanies have reported actual revenues equal to estimated revenues, and 39% of the companies have reported actual \nrevenues below estimated revenues. The percentage of companies reporting revenues above estimates is below the 1-\nyear average (62%), below the 5-year average (69%), and below the 10-year average (64%). Historical averages reflect \nactual results from all 500 companies, not the actual results from the percentage of companies that have reported through \nthis point in time. \nAt the sector level, the Information Technology (85%) and Health Care (80%) sectors have the highest percentages of \ncompanies reporting revenues above estimates, while the Materials (36%) and Utilities (39%) sectors have the lowest \npercentages of companies reporting revenues above estimates. \nRevenue Surprise Percentage (+1.2%) is Below 5-Year Average \nIn aggregate, companies are reporting revenues that are 1.2% above expectations.

Six sectors have recorded an increase in their earnings growth rate or a decrease in their \nearnings decline since the end of the quarter due to upward revisions to earnings estimates and positive earnings surprises, \nled by the Communications Services (to 23.2% from 10.3%), Consumer Discretionary (to 9.1% from -0.1%), and Financials \n(to 7.1% from -0.7%) sectors. These three sectors have also been the largest contributors to the increase in the earnings \ngrowth rate for the index since September 30. On the other hand, five sectors have recorded a decrease in their earnings \ngrowth rate or an increase in their earnings decline since the end of the quarter due to downward revisions to EPS estimates \nand negative earnings surprises, led by the Materials (to -11.4% from -2.7%) and Information Technology (to 7.2% from \n15.6%) sectors. The Information Technology sector has also been the largest detractor to the increase in the earnings \ngrowth rate for the index since September 30. \nIn the Financials sector, the positive EPS surprises reported by JPMorgan Chase ($4.37 vs. $3.99), Progressive \nCorporation ($4.46 vs. $3.69), Well Fargo ($1.42 vs. $1.28), and Morgan Stanley ($1.88 vs. $1.59) have been substantial \ncontributors to the increase in the earnings growth rate for the index since September 30. As a result, the blended earnings \ngrowth rate for the Financials sector has increased to 7.1% from -0.7% over this period. \nIn the Communication Services sector, the positive EPS surprises reported by Alphabet ($2.12 vs. $1.84) and Meta \nPlatforms ($6.03 vs. $5.25) have been significant contributors to the increase in the earnings growth rate for the index \nsince September 30. As a result, the blended earnings growth rate for the Communication Services sector has increased \nto 23.2% from 10.3% over this period. \nIn the Consumer Discretionary sector, the positive EPS surprises reported by Amazon.com ($1.43 vs. $1.14) and General \nMotors ($2.96 vs. $2.38) have been substantial contributors to the increase in the earnings growth rate for the index since \nSeptember 30. As a result, the blended earnings growth rate for the Consumer Discretionary sector has increased to 9.1% \nfrom -0.1% over this period. \nIn the Information Technology sector, the negative EPS surprise reported by Apple ($0.97 vs. $1.60) has been the largest \ndetractor to the increase in the earnings growth rate for the index since September 30. The actual (GAAP) EPS for Apple \nof $0.97 included a net charge of $10.2 billion related to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court\u2019s State \nAid decision. The majority of analysts provided EPS estimates for Apple on a GAAP basis. As a result, the blended earnings \ngrowth rate for the Information Technology sector has decreased to 7.2% from 15.6% over this period. \nHealth Care Sector Has Seen Largest Increase in Revenues since September 30 \nThe blended (year-over-year) revenue growth rate for Q3 2024 of 5.5% is above the estimate of 4.7% at the end of the \nthird quarter (September 30). Six sectors have recorded an increase in their revenue growth rate or a decrease in their \nrevenue decline since the end of the quarter due to upward revisions to revenue estimates and positive revenue surprises, \nled by the Health Care (to 10.3% from 6.9%) sector. This sector has also been the largest contributor to the increase in \nthe revenue growth rate since the end of the quarter. On the other hand, four sectors have recorded a decrease in their \nrevenue growth rate or an increase in their revenue decline since the end of the quarter due to downward revisions to \nrevenue estimates and negative revenue surprises, led by the Utilities (to 4.0% from 6.7%) and Energy (to -5.4% from     \n-2.8%) sectors. The Energy sector has also been the largest detractor to the increase in the revenue growth rate for the \nindex since the end of the quarter. The Consumer Staples sector is reporting the same revenue growth rate (1.7%) relative \nto expectations on September 30. \n \n \nCopyright \u00a9 2024 FactSet Research Systems Inc.

As a result, the blended revenue growth rate \nfor the Health Care sector has increased to 10.3% from 6.9% over this period. \nIn the Energy sector, the downward revisions to revenue estimates (to $93.98 billion from $96.31 billion) and negative \nrevenue surprise ($90.01 billion vs. $93.98 billion) for Exxon Mobil have been the largest detractors to the increase in the \nrevenue growth rate for the index since September 30. As a result, the blended revenue decline for the Energy sector has \nincreased to -5.4% from -2.8% over this period. \nEarnings Growth: 5.4% \nThe blended (year-over-year) earnings growth rate for the S&P 500 for Q3 2024 is 5.4%, which is below the 5-year average \nearnings growth rate of 10.0% and below the 10-year average earnings growth rate of 8.5%. If 5.4% is the actual growth \nrate for the quarter, it will mark the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year earnings growth for the index. \nSeven of the eleven sectors are reporting (or have reported) year-over-year earnings growth, led by the Communication \nServices and Health Care sectors. On the other hand, three sectors are reporting (or have reported) a year-over-year \ndecline in earnings, led by the Energy and Materials sectors. \nCommunication Services: Alphabet and Meta Platforms Led Year-Over-Year Growth \nThe Communication Services sector reported the highest (year-over-year) earnings growth rate of all eleven sectors at \n23.2%. At the industry level, 4 of the 5 industries in the sector reported year-over-year earnings growth: Entertainment \n(49%), Wireless Telecommunication Services (41%), Interactive Media & Services (33%), and Media (2%). On the other \nhand, the Diversified Telecommunication Services (-4%) industry is the only industry in the sector that reported a year-\nover-year decline in earnings. \nAt the company level, Alphabet ($2.12 vs. $1.55) and Meta Platforms ($6.03 vs. $4.39) were the largest contributors to \nearnings growth for the sector. If these companies were excluded, the blended (year-over-year) earnings growth rate for \nCommunication Services sector would fall to 10.8% from 23.2%. \nHealth Care: Pfizer Is Largest Contributor to Year-Over-Year Growth \nThe Health Care sector is reporting the second-highest (year-over-year) earnings growth rate of all eleven sectors at \n13.5%. At the industry level, 3 of the 5 industries in the sector are reporting year-over-year earnings growth: Biotechnology \n(38%), Pharmaceuticals (33%), and Health Care Equipment & Supplies (8%). On the other hand, two industries are \nreporting a year-over-year decline in earnings: Life Sciences Tools & Services (-7%) and Health Care Providers & Services \n(-7%). \nAt the company level, Pfizer ($1.06 vs. -$0.17) is the largest contributor to earnings growth for the sector.
