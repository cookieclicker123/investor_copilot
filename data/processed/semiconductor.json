Introduction\n1.1. Semiconductor supply chain disruptions\nThe Semiconductor Supply Chain (SSC) is a type of\ncritical infrastructure that underpins the global tech-\nnology industry (Callarman et al. 2004), enabling the\nproduction and distribution of semiconductors essen-\ntial for a wide range of electronic devices, from smart-\nphones to medical equipment to automobiles. This com-\nplex and highly integrated network (Figure 1) involves\nmyriad stages, including design, development, fabri-\ncation, assembly, testing, packaging, and distribution,\nengaging a wide range of entities, from fabless compa-\nnies to foundries and integrated device manufacturers\n(IDMs). The global scale of the supply chain, involv-\ning substantial investments in research and development\n(R&D) and high technological sophistication, has posi-\ntioned semiconductors as foundational components of\nthe modern digital economy, driving advancements in\nthe fields of computing, communications, and consumer\nelectronics.\nHowever, the SSC faces numerous challenges and vul-\nnerabilities, highlighted by recent disruptions such as\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions like\nthe Russia-Ukraine conflict and trade tensions between\nCONTACT Je\ufb00H. Y. Yeung\nje\ufb00_yeung@cuhk.edu.hk\nthe US and China. These challenges underscore the crit-\nical need for enhanced resilience and strategic plan-\nning to avert future crises. For instance, the COVID-\n19 pandemic caused widespread factory shutdowns and\nshipping delays1, while the Russia-Ukraine conflict has\nled to energy supply shortages and increased commod-\nity prices2. These turbulent years have led to academic\ninsights into the resilience and viability of the SSC (Fu\net al. 2023). For example, unexpected fluctuations and\nshocks mean that supply cannot meet demand in a timely\nmanner, and supply chains take time to recover (Simchi-\nLevi and Simchi-Levi 2020) and are subject to intense\nstress testings (Haren and Simchi-Levi 2020; Collier et al.\n2023). Furthermore, Ivanov and Dolgui (2022a) note that\nresource shortages caused by extreme shocks and long-\nlasting disruptions may have global ripple effects on sup-\nply chains in the automotive and electronics industries.\nThe complexity of the SSC, together with the critical\nnature of semiconductors across a wide range of tech-\nnologies and critical factors (Figure 2), makes it a focal\npoint of geopolitical and economic considerations (Mat-\nsuo 2015), and a balanced approach is required to manage\nrisks and ensure continuity.\nStrategies to strengthen the resilience of the SSC\nhave become a priority interest for academia, industry\n\u00a9 2024 The Author(s).

Structure of the semiconductor supply chain: business models.\nstakeholders, and governments. Efforts include diversi-\nfying manufacturing bases (Lima et al. 2021; Shin et al.\n2019), investing in domestic production capabilities, pro-\nmoting international collaborations, and leveraging tech-\nnological advancements such as artificial intelligence and\nbig data analytics. Additionally, policy initiatives and\ngovernment incentives aim to support the semiconduc-\ntor industry, addressing challenges such as talent short-\nages and the need for innovation to keep pace with\nrapidly changing technological demands (Fu and Chien\n2019). Ensuring the resilience and sustainability of the\nSSC (Okada and Shirahada 2022) is paramount to the\ncontinued growth and innovation of the global technol-\nogy sector, making it a topic of great importance and\ninterest.\nThis study comprehensively reviews the literature on\nSSC disruptions. We provide valuable insights into the\ndevelopment of resilient supply chain structures in the\nsemiconductor industry and identify potential topics for\nfuture research. Historically, the prevailing assumptions\nin supply chain research have been challenged; these\ninclude the notions of uninterrupted supply despite occa-\nsional disruptions and the sufficiency of resources to\nmeet demand, as discussed in seminal studies such as\nthose by Ivanov and Dolgui (2022a) on supply short-\nages and the extensive reviews of the SSC literature by\nM\u00f6nch, Uzsoy, and Fowler (2018a, 2018b), and Uzsoy,\nFowler, and M\u00f6nch (2018). From a value-creation per-\nspective, as suggested by Ivanov (2023), contrary to the\ndominant cost efficiency-oriented thinking of previous\nyears, the next generation of supply chain designs, as\nargued by Ivanov (2021a), should be dynamically adapt-\nable and structurally changeable. This shift highlights the\nimportance of innovative approaches to addressing cur-\nrent and future SSC challenges, underscoring the need for\nfuture research that not only addresses immediate dis-\nruptions but also ensures the long-term resilience and\nsustainability of the SSC.\n1.2. Recent research on supply chain disruptions\nFirst, we examine selected research reviews on supply\nchain disruptions to identify the key theories and frame-\nworks (Table 1). The need for stress testing advocated\nby Simchi-Levi and Simchi-Levi (2020) and the strategic\nrecovery frameworks presented by Simchi-Levi (2020)\nhighlight the importance of preparedness and adaptabil-\nity in supply chain management. The COVID-19 pan-\ndemic brought these issues to the forefront, with Haren\nand Simchi-Levi (2020) accurately predicting the timing\nof the pandemic and its impact on global supply chains.\nAldrighetti et al. (2021) emphasise the delicate bal-\nance between cost efficiency and resilience in the design\nof supply chain networks, suggesting that future research\nshould explore dynamic adaptation models. This argu-\nment is consistent with that of Dolgui, Ivanov, and\nSokolov (2018), who analyse the ripple effect of disrup-\ntions in one part of the supply chain cascadeing through\nthe network, causing widespread impact. Dolgui, Ivanov,\nand Sokolov (2020) introduce the concept of the recon-\nfigurable supply chain, also known as the X-network,\nhighlighting the importance of flexibility and modular-\nity in supply chain design to withstand and adapt to\nunexpected changes. Their work, along with that of Hos-\nseini, Ivanov, and Dolgui (2019), who review quantita-\ntive methods (Ak\u00e7al\u0131 and \u00c7etinkaya 2011) for resilience\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH\n3\nFigure 2. Semiconductor supply chain: integrated process \ufb02ow and critical factors.\nanalysis, provides a foundation for understanding sup-\nply chain vulnerabilities and the capabilities needed to\nmanage risks.\nIvanov\u2019s series of studies (i.e. Ivanov and Dolgui 2020,\n2021, 2022b; Ivanov 2021b, 2022; Ivanov et al. 2022) con-\ntributes significantly to the field by describing a viable\nsupply chain model that integrates the dimensions of\nagility, resilience, and sustainability. His research extends\nthe concept of resilience to survivability, particularly\nin the context of intertwined supply networks (Feiz-\nabadi et al. 2023; Wang and Yao 2023) affected by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Ivanov and Dolgui (2022a)\nfurther discuss the implications of the shortage econ-\nomy for supply chain management, and Ivanov (2023)\nintroduces the Industry 5.0 framework, advocating for\na viability-based integration of resilience, sustainability,\n4\nW.

The\nactive usage of resilience assets framework proposed by\nIvanov (2021a) for post-COVID-19 supply chain man-\nagement focuses on lean resilience, balancing efficiency\nwith the ability to respond to disruptions. This frame-\nwork, along with the work of Ivanov and Keskin (2023),\nis particularly relevant to the SSC, which requires a del-\nicate balance between lean operations and the ability to\nwithstand and quickly recover from disruptions. (Table 2)\nIn summary, the literature presents a consensus on the\nneed for supply chains to be stress-tested, reconfigurable,\nand adaptable to cope with disruptions. This review syn-\nthesises these perspectives, providing insights into the\nresilience and viability of SSC, and sets the stage for a\ndetailed exploration of the methodologies, strategies, and\ntechnologies that can contribute to the development of\nrobust SSC designs.\n1.3. Importance of semiconductor supply chain\ndisruptions\nTo understand the resilience and viability of SSCs\n(Simchi-Levi and Simchi-Levi 2020), it is important to\nfirst recognise the major disruptions that the semiconductor\nindustry has recently faced. For instance, the chip short-\nage experienced by the automotive industry since late\n2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has\naffected almost all global auto manufacturers (M\u00fcnch\nand Hartmann 2023), creating production stoppages and\nbacklogs (Ramani, Ghosh, and Sodhi 2022). The effects\nof this shortage are expected to last until 2023 or even\n2024. The scarcity of semiconductors has far-reaching\nconsequences. As Ivanov and Dolgui (2022a) point out,\nlong-term resource shortages and hyper-inflation risks\npose new and unexpected challenges that could have\nglobal ripple effects.\nThe magnitude of the issue is evidenced by the dra-\nmatics decline in automobile manufacturing (Hoppe and\nPodkowik 2022; Krolikowski and Naggert 2021). Volk-\nswagen\u2019s headquarters factory in Wolfsburg, Germany\nproduced approximately 300,000 vehicles in 2021 and\n400,000 in 2022. Both figures are well below the pre-\nCOVID-19 average of almost 780,000. One of the issues\nleading to the reduction in output was the chip shortages.\nThomas Schaefer, CEO of Volkswagen, said that dur-\ning the supply chain\u2019s most tumultuous time, suppliers\nabruptly cancelled deliveries with just one night\u2019s notice\nand chip prices rose by as much as 800%. Schaefer\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH\n5\nlamented, \u2018The costs are so ridiculously exorbitant; it\u2019s a\nnightmare for the firm\u20193.\nOver the past two years (2021\u20132022), chip supply con-\nstraints have cost US automaker Ford a production loss of\n1.3 million cars. However, Ford\u2019s constrained chip sup-\nply is not related to cutting-edge silicon chips but rather\nto traditional-process chips using mature technology. Jim\nFarley, CEO of Ford, stated, \u2018One thing that keeps me\nup at night is traditional-process chips\u20194. These include\nthe MOSFET chips that Ford is having difficult sourc-\ning. The MOSFET chips used in Ford F-150 windshield\nwipers cost only US$0.4 per piece, but Ford suffered a\nproduction loss of 40,000 cars because of their shortage.\nThe ripple effects of widespread disruptions across\nvarious industries using semiconductor technology\nextend beyond the automotive industry to consumer\nelectronics (Kliesen and Werner 2022), telecommunica-\ntions, and even critical medical equipments. As Dolgui,\nIvanov, and Sokolov (2018) argue, ripple effects in supply\nchains can lead to cascading failures across intercon-\nnected networks, thereby exacerbating the initial impact\nof the disruption.\n1.4. Objectives of the paper\nThe primary objective of this literature review is to pro-\nvide a comprehensive and up-to-date analysis of research\non SSC disruptions. Specifically, it explores two types\nof disruptions, namely security issues and public health\nevents, and their implications for the semiconductor\nindustry.\nFirst, our review focuses on security issues caused\nby geopolitics, industrial shifts, and the US\u2013China trade\nwar. By examining the relevant literature, this section\nsheds light on the security challenges faced by the SSC\nand the impact of geopolitical factors on SSC disruptions.\nSecond, our review considers disruptions arising from\npublic health events of international concern. Drawing\non studies related to the scale of supply chain viability\nand resilience, this section examines the effects of such\nevents on the semiconductor industry. Finally, our review\nelucidates the challenges and opportunities associated\nwith these disruptions. In summary, this paper seeks to\nunderstand SSC disruptions by answering the following\nquestions:\n(i) How do global public health crises and geopoliti-\ncal dynamics affect SSC resilience, and what proac-\ntive strategies can be implemented to enhance this\nresilience effectively?\n(ii) Based on the latest findings, what are the critical gaps\nin research on SSC disruptions, and what theoretical\nframeworks could guide the development of innova-\ntive solutions?\n(iii) What specific policy measures and research initia-\ntives should be prioritised to improve supply chain\nresilience, informed by current literature?\nBy addressing these research questions, our review\nprovides a comprehensive understanding of SSC dis-\nruptions, identifies research gaps, and offers insights to\nresearchers, practitioners, and policymakers.\n1.5. Scope and organisation of the paper\nMotivated by the recent disruptions and questions men-\ntioned above, we conducted a comprehensive review of\n203 articles. This review predominantly examined the\nacademic literature on the supply chains, while incorpo-\nrating important industry reports to better understand\nmanagerial discourse.\nWe adopted bibliometric techniques to identify\nresearch streams in the supply chain literature (Figure 3).\nThe data collection process involved searching the Sco-\npus database for articles and reviews written in English\nthat contained specific terms related to supply chain\nresilience in their title or topic. For instance, the key-\nwords consisted of the phrase \u2018semiconductor supply\nchain\u2019 combined with at least one of the following terms:\n\u2018resilience\u2019, \u2018resiliency\u2019, \u2018resilient\u2019, \u2018disrupt\u2019, and \u2018disrup-\ntion\u2019. In the Scopus database, we found that the earliest\nstudies using the keywords \u2018semiconductor\u2019 AND \u2018sup-\nply\u2019 AND \u2018chains\u2019 AND \u2018resilience\u2019 was published in\n2006.\nAs our research questions focussed on policies and\ngeopolitical issues, some relevant studies or reports may\nnot be included in the Scopus database. Therefore,\nGoogle Scholar was used as a supplementary source to\nensure a comprehensive review and inclusion of relevant\nstudies and reports that may not be indexed in the Sco-\npus database. This approach allowed for a broader and\nmore inclusive analysis of the subject, encompassing a\nwider range of academic and grey literature, including\ngovernment reports, policy analyses, and other schol-\narly documents that not always captured by traditional\nacademic databases.\nThe rest of this paper is organised as follows (Figure 4).\nIn Section 2, we provide an overview of the main concepts\nin research on the semiconductor industry and the SSC to\nprovide context for our review. Based on the most com-\nmonly discussed topics, such as inventory management,\ndemand forecasting and manufacturing, we present a\nbrief summary of recently published articles on semicon-\nductors and electronics. In Sections 3 and 4, we discuss\ntwo types of SSC disruptions. Security and geopoliti-\ncal issues are discussed in Section 3, and the impact of\n6\nW. XIONG ET AL.\nFigure 3.

In\nSection 5, we identify research gaps and suggest future\nresearch directions.\n2. Overview of semiconductor supply chain\ndisruptions\nThe SSC is a cornerstone of modern electronics, involv-\ning a complex network of entities that design, manu-\nfacture, test, package, and distribute semiconductors5.\nThis supply chain is crucial for a wide range of prod-\nucts, such as smartphones, laptops, automobiles, and\nmedical devices, all of which rely on microprocessors,\nmemory modules, and integrated circuits powered by\nsemiconductors. However, because of its complexity, the\ndevelopment of a semiconductor product can involve up\nto 1,200 process steps over a six-to-eight-week cycle and\nrequire travel over thousands of miles between differ-\nent locations and companies involved in the production\nprocess. In this section, we briefly describe the SSC and\nidentify two main types of disruptions to this supply\nchain.\n2.1. The semiconductor supply chain\nAs semiconductors are used in a wide range of electronic\ndevices, their supply chain plays a crucial role in busi-\nness. In this section, we briefly present an SSC framework\n(Figure 2). The SSC has three main stages: (1) research\nand development (R&D), (2) production, and (3) end\nuse. We adopt this three-stage structure for simplicity.\nDifferent classifications that further include production\nand production inputs can be found in studies such as\nKhan, Mann, and Peterson (2021).\nR&D is the driving force behind the entire SSC. R&D\nincludes both pre-competitive, exploratory studies and\nresearch on fundamental technologies and competitive\nresearch aimed at advancing a company\u2019s position in the\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH\n7\nsemiconductor industry. R&D results have a significant\nimpact on each segment of the SSC. Policymakers are\nparticularly interested in R&D because it is a key driver\nof innovation and competitiveness in the semiconductor\nindustry. For instance, Jennifer O\u2019Bryan (2021), Gov-\nernment Affairs Director at SPIE, provides an in-depth\nreview of public policy issues affecting semiconductor\nR&D, encompassing the supply chain challenges of fund-\ning and export controls. Rasiah and Wong (2021) assess\nthe industrial upgrading of the semiconductor indus-\ntry in East Asia, focussing on technological upgrading\nand the importance of R&D in attracting companies to\nfrontier activities. The European Union (EU) also plays\nan important role in the value chain of R&D, and the\nEuropean Commission plans to increase the EU\u2019s share\nof global semiconductor production by 2030 through\ninvestments in semiconductor R&D and manufacturing\n(De Boeck, L\u00e8quepeys, and Kutter 2023).\nChip production is at the core of the SSC and can be\ndivided into three segments: design, manufacturing (or\nfabrication), and assembly, testing, and packaging (ATP).\nDesign involves specification, logic design, physical\ndesign, and validation and verification (Mirhoseini et al.\n2021). Specification determines the function of a chip and\nhow it should work. Logic design and physical design\ntransform a schematic diagram into a physical layout.\nThe validation and verification stages ensure that the\nchips work as expected. In this process, electronic design\nautomation (EDA) software is used to design complex\nchips containing billions of interconnected transistors\nand electrical components. Core intellectual property\n(IP) consists of reusable modular parts of designs, that\ncan be licenced by design companies and incorporated\ninto their designs (Khan, Mann, and Peterson 2021).\nRecent advances in product design analytics have enabled\nlarge companies such as Intel (Heiney et al. 2021) to\nachieve their sustainability and profitability goals.\nFor fabrication, a cylinder of semiconducting material\nis cut into disc-shaped wafers. It takes two steps to make\nchips from these wafers (Nakazawa and Kulkarni 2018;\nHwang and Jang 2020; Yu and Lee 2020; Siess et al. 2020;\nDong and Ye 2022; Lee et al. 2020; Misra et al. 2022; Wan\nand Shin 2022; Wang and Zhang 2016) creating tran-\nsistors and electrical devices in layers of material inside\nthe silicon and creating interconnects between electrical\ndevices in insulating layers above the silicon. Circuits are\nformed by electrical devices and interconnects. M\u00f6nch,\nUzsoy, and Fowler (2018a) provide a more detailed intro-\nduction to semiconductor productions, from wafer to\nfinal test. Neumaier, Pindl, and Lemme (2019) discuss the\nintegration of graphene, an unconventional material with\nunique properties, into established semiconductor fabri-\ncation lines as a critical step towards commercialisation.\nTable 3.

The ATP stage of the SSC is currently\nexperiencing significant advancements and challenges\ndue to the offshore nature of most outsourced semi-\nconductor assembly (Jo et al. 2019) and test facilities.\nResearch on the ATP stage of the SSC emphasises secu-\nrity (Chang, Chang, and Wang 2022), quality (Quinn and\nLoferer 2013; Cheon et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2021; Li\net al. 2022), information transparency (Lu et al. 2013),\nand strategic geographic positioning. Noor et al. (2023)\ndiscuss the major shifts underway in the semiconductor\nindustry, advanced packaging techniques, and the impor-\ntance of packaging R&D to address design and security\nchallenges.\nSemiconductors have a wide range of end uses across\nvarious industries. Integrated device manufacturers such\nas Samsung and Intel make huge profits on the demand\nside by providing high-quality memory and CPUs. In\nconsumer electronics products such as smartphones, lap-\ntops, tablets, and televisions, semiconductors are used\nfor functions such as processing, memory, and display.\nAs technology continues to advance, the demand for\nsemiconductors and their end uses will continue to grow.\n2.2. Vulnerabilities in the event of disruptions\nThe SSC, like any complex global supply chain (Moham-\nmad, Elomri, and Kerbache 2022), is susceptible to var-\nious vulnerabilities in the event of disruptions. Tech-\nnology giants such as Apple (SinghKang, SinghBhatti,\nand Patil 2023) also face vulnerabilities in the SSC\nnetwork. These vulnerabilities arise from the inter-\ndependencies, geographic dispersion, and complex coor-\ndination required within the semiconductor industry.\nUnderstanding and addressing these vulnerabilities is\ncrucial to mitigating the impact of disruptions and ensur-\ning the resilience of the SSC (Table 3).\nOne key vulnerability is the dependece on a limited\nnumber of suppliers for critical components and mate-\nrials (Sharma et al. 2023; Yu et al. 2024). The semi-\nconductor industry often operates under a just-in-time\n8\nW. XIONG ET AL.\nmanufacturing model (Firth et al. 2006) in which pro-\nduction schedules (Chung et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2019) are\nclosely synchronised with the availability of inputs. How-\never, disruptions caused by geopolitical tensions or public\nhealth events can affect the flow of materials, leading to\nshortages and production delays. When few alternative\nsuppliers exist or in-house production capacity is limited,\nsupply chain vulnerability increases (Leu and Liu 2022).\nAnother vulnerability arises from the complex and\nglobal nature of the SSC (Mohammed and Khan 2022).\nThe SSC involves the coordination and synchronisation\nof activities across multiple tiers of suppliers, manufac-\nturers, and distributors, often spanning different coun-\ntries and regions. Disruptions affecting one part of the\nsupply chain can quickly propagate upstream or down-\nstream, amplifying the overall impact through a rip-\nple effect. Studies demonstrate how these ripple effects\nimpact on the flow of goods and materials (Brusset\net al. 2023), circular flows (Park et al. 2022), and recovery\n(KEk et al. 2022). This vulnerability is particularly pro-\nnounced when disruptions occur simultaneously in mul-\ntiple regions or when key production hubs are affected.\nFurthermore, the long lead times inherent in semicon-\nductor manufacturing contribute to vulnerability in the\nevent of disruptions occur (Sharma et al. 2023; Welling,\nNoel, and Ismail 2021). The semiconductor industry\noperates on extended product development cycles, with\nsubstantial investments in R&D, production tools, and\nfabrication facilities. Taking non-volatile memory as an\nexample, Chen and Chien (2018) develop a decision-\nmaking framework for demand forecasting in semicon-\nductor manufacturing (Chien et al. 2024), which is cru-\ncial given the long lead times and the need for smart pro-\nduction to mitigate disruptions. Disruptions can affect\nthe delicate balance between supply and demand, leading\nto imbalances that will take time to correct. This vulnera-\nbility can exacerbate the impact of disruptions, resulting\nin prolonged shortages or overcapacity. The increasing\ncomplexity of semiconductor products and the need for\nspecialised knowledge and expertise also create vulnera-\nbility. In light of the digital transformation of the supply\nchain (Mitra, Kapoor, and Gupta 2022), the SSC relies on\nskilled labour, IT expertise, and specialised equipment.\nIndustry 4.0 also highlights the need to develop human\ncapital in the logistics and supply chain sector (Rah-\nman et al. 2022). Disruptions can affect the availability\nof skilled personnel, limit access to critical knowledge, or\nimpair the functioning of specialised equipment, thereby\naffecting overall production capacity and product quality.\nTable 3 descriptively illustrates the vulnerabilities at\ndifferent stages of the SSC. The impact levels are indica-\ntive and may vary depending on specific contexts and\nbusiness models.\n2.3. Classification of disruptions\nIn the realm of supply chain management and the semi-\nconductor industry, recent years have seen the emergence\nof two distinct types of disruptions, which have generated\nconsiderable research interest (Table 4).\nThe first type of disruption revolves around security\nissues stemming from geopolitics, industrial shifts, and\nthe US\u2013China trade war. These factors have significantly\naffected the SCC, prompting a re-evaluation of current\nresearch and requiring further research into new avenues\nto address these security challenges.\nThe second type of disruption centres on public health\nevents of international concern. These events, which can\nhave far\u2013reaching consequences, pose significant chal-\nlenges to supply chain resilience, particularly in the semi-\nconductor industry. The viability of supply chains is also\nbeing tested. It is therefore imperative to examine the\nimplications of these events and identify strategies to\nenhance supply chain resilience in the face of such dis-\nruptions (Ivanov and Dolgui 2020, 2021).\n3. Security issues and geopolitical disruptions\n3.1. Overview of security issues in the\nsemiconductor supply chain\nSecurity issues in the SSC have become increasingly\nimportant in recent years, as the semiconductor industry\nhas become more globalised and interdependent (Linci-\ncome 2021). These issues include concerns about tech-\nnology transfer, IP theft, and the potential for foreign\ngovernments to exploit supply chain vulnerabilities. To\naddress these concerns, a trend towards deglobalisa-\ntion and localisation of the semiconductor industry has\nemerged as countries and companies seek to reduce their\ndependence on foreign suppliers and protect their IP\n(Nagata et al. 2023; Sami et al. 2024).\nSince 2019, the US has implemented a series of\nincreasingly extensive export controls on the SSC. The\ninitial policy was based on national security concerns\nabout critical infrastructure. The export controls targeted\nHuawei, a Chinese national champion whose global rev-\nenue in 2019 was close to that of Microsoft (Bown 2020a,\n2020b). In September 2020, media reported that Chi-\nnese semiconductor foundry company SMIC could be\nblocked from purchasing US\u2013made equipment, semi-\nconductor designs, and software by being added to the\nEntity List6. In July 2019, the Japanese government\nannounced potential new export controls on key inputs\nfor semiconductor manufacturers in South Korea, such\nas hydrogen fluoride, fluorinated polyimides, and pho-\ntoresist.\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH\n9\nTable 4.

Researchers at Texas Instruments Inc. has\nconducted several studies on cyber-physical IT assess-\nment tools, such as Cayetano et al. (2018) and Laghari\net al. (2023, 2021). These tools are used to identify secu-\nrity vulnerabilities among current semiconductor com-\npanies, and such studies reveal a lack of focus on cyber-\nsecurity programmes (Budak et al. 2022). Despite the\nimportance of information systems in SSC management,\nstudies have so far largely overlook this aspect. However,\nsoftware such as MES and ERP systems forms the back-\nbone of SSC operations, leaving room for future research\non this topics. A recent literature review conducted by\nCheung, Bell, and Bhattacharjya (2021) on cybersecurity\nin supply chain management offers valuable insights that\ncan inform further exploration of this critical area.\nOpportunities and risks coexist in the context of\nuncertainty. As Chorzempa (2023) points out, compa-\nnies and governments face much greater uncertainty and\nmust evaluate the risk of dependence on both the US and\nChina. In this section, we review the development of the\nSSC and discuss the major changes over time. We then\npresent the results of a detailed literature review carried\nout to identify and analyse the security challenges faced\nby the SSC.\n3.2. Geopolitical factors affecting the\nsemiconductor industry\n3.2.1. Impact of industrial shifts on the\nsemiconductor supply chain\nThe semiconductor industry has seen major changes in\nterms of global distribution in recent decades (Figure 5).\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the US was the dominant\nplayer in the industry. However, Japan began to com-\npete with the US as the leading producer of semicon-\nductors (Irwin 1996). The 1980s marked the beginning\nof a period in which semiconductors were central to\nmajor trade conflicts. As part of the 1986 US\u2013Japan\nFigure 5. Key Events in the Development of the Semiconductor\nIndustry.\nSemiconductor Trade Agreement, the Japanese govern-\nment agreed to end the \u2018dumping\u2019 of semiconductors\non global markets and to guarantee 20% of its domestic\nsemiconductor market to foreign producers within five\nyears.\nWith Japanese supply limited and the US industry hav-\ning exited the dynamic random-access memory (DRAM)\n10\nW. XIONG ET AL.\nmarket, there was a shortage of memory chips. This\nopportunity accelerated the development and entry of\nother semiconductor companies. In the 2000s, South\nKorean companies Samsung and SK Hynix became major\nplayers in the global semiconductor industry, with a focus\non memory chips, which are essential components of\nmany electronic devices. They quickly became major\nplayers in the memory chip market, and the US govern-\nment imposed anti-dumping duties on Korean DRAM\nchips in 1992. The differences between these two disputes\nhave been widely discussed. Notably, unlike Japan, with\nits passive government support, South Korea settled the\ndispute in court (Young 2004).\nTaiwan also emerged as a major player in the semi-\nconductor industry, becoming the \u2018Silicon Valley of the\nEast\u2019 (Mathews 1997), with companies such as TSMC\nand UMC becoming major producers of semiconduc-\ntors. Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor industry benefited from a\nstrong government focus on industry development, as\nwell as a large pool of experienced engineers and tech-\nnicians. South Korea and Taiwan (Danilin and Yaroslav\n2023) have become world leaders in the production of the\nsmallest and most technologically advanced chips (10 nm\nand below). However, this could change within three to\nfive years, as leading Taiwanese and South Korean com-\npanies plan to build cutting-edge manufacturing plants\nin the US.\nEuropean countries have a strong R&D presence in\nthe semiconductor industry (Schneider-Petsinger 2021;\nEjdys and Szpilko 2023), with research centres and uni-\nversities contributing to the development of new tech-\nnologies. It is widely recognised that competitiveness\nis linked to innovation capacity, in particular the abil-\nity to engage in open innovation processes (Huggins\net al. 2023). The EU is working to increase its com-\npetitive advantage over other regions in the industry.\nUnder the European Chips Act of 18 April 2023, the\nEU will continue to invest in strengthening the semi-\nconductor ecosystem7. Ciani and Nardo (2022) report\nthat the EU is a net importer of transistors, diodes, and\nsimilar semiconductor devices (mainly from China), as\nwell as electronic integrated circuits (mainly from Tai-\nwan). In particular, Taiwan is the leading source of EU\nimports of processors, other electronic circuits, DRAM,\nand multi-combinational memories.\nIn recent years, China has also become a major player\nin the global semiconductor industry, with the Chi-\nnese government heavily investing in the semiconductor\nindustry. Chinese companies such as Huawei, HiSilicon,\nand SMIC, have become major players in the global mar-\nket. However, the industry still faces challenges in terms\nof IP and technology transfer.\n3.2.2. The US\u2013China trade war and its implications\nIn 2017, the US government Launched an investigation\ninto China\u2019s unfair trade practices under Section 301,\nthe same law that ultimately led to the 1986 US\u2013Japan\nSemiconductor Trade Agreement (Bown 2020a).\nThe trade war between the US and China has led to\nthe imposition of tariffs, export controls, and other trade\nrestrictions on various goods, including semiconductors.\nThese measures have disrupted the flow of semiconduc-\ntor components, materials, and equipment between the\ntwo countries. As a result, semiconductor manufacturers\nhave faced challenges in sourcing critical inputs, leading\nto supply chain disruptions and potential shortages.\nOne of the consequences of US\u2013China trade war is the\nreconfiguration of global supply chains. As reported by\nVaras et al. (2020), the key driving force behind location\ncompetitiveness is government incentives. US incentives\nare at the lower end of the range, well below those of\nAsian countries with a large semiconductor manufac-\nturing footprint. The cost advantage of other countries\nover the US has led to shifts in production facilities, new\nmanufacturing partnerships, and a search for alternative\nsuppliers in regions outside the direct scope of the trade\nwar. To mitigate the risks associated with the trade war,\nsemiconductor companies have been forced to reassess\ntheir supply chain strategies and diversify their sourc-\ning locations. Such efforts aim to reduce dependency on\na single country or region and strengthen supply chain\nresilience.\nFurthermore, the US\u2013China trade war has raised con-\ncerns over IP protection and cybersecurity. The semicon-\nductor industry is characterised by extensive IP rights\n(Chen, Khan, and Iftikhar 2021), and the trade war has\nincreased concerns about the theft or violation of these\nvaluable assets. Both countries have implemented mea-\nsures to protect IP, including export controls and restric-\ntions on technology transfer, affecting collaboration and\nknowledge sharing within the industry. For instance, on\n3 January 2020, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS)\nof the US Department of Commerce unveiled the first in\na series of proposed rules to limit the export of emerging\ntechnologies8.\nAddressing the implications of the US\u2013China trade\nwar for the SSC requires a comprehensive understand-\ning of evolving trade policies, the regulatory landscape,\nand geopolitical dynamics. It also requires proactive sup-\nply chain risk management strategies, such as diversify-\ning supply chain sourcing, developing contingency plans,\nand fostering partnerships with trusted suppliers and\nmanufacturing facilities located in regions less affected by\nthe trade war. However, some scholars (Luo and Van Ass-\nche 2023) argue that the US Act does not mark the end of\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH\n11\nTable 5.

Analysis of the literature on geopolitical\ndisruptions\nThe main categories of geopolitical disruptions iden-\ntified in our literature review include security issues,\noutsourcing, cross-regional collaboration, localisation,\nglobal value chain, and industrial policies (Table 5). We\ndiscuss these categories in detail below.\nIn terms of security issues, IP controls have generated\nmuch discussion because chip manufacturing involves\nmultiple IPs that are mainly concentrated in companies\nin the US. Although IP and related technology trans-\nfer could help semiconductor companies to develop core\ncompetence and allow them to gain competitive advan-\ntages (Liao and Hu 2007), IP theft is achievable through\nreverse engineering. Integrated circuit camouflaging and\nlogic locking (Subiah and Chinnathevar 2024) are two\ntechniques that can thwart reverse engineering by end\nusers or foundries. Shamsi et al. (2019) conduct a com-\nprehensive review of hardware IP protection through\nlogic obfuscation.\nThe critical importance of localised SSC innovation,\neducation, and R&D is widely recognised in the literature.\nFor example, Chang et al. (2021) state that the success\nof Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor industry can be attributed\nto R&D investments at the industry level and the gov-\nernment\u2019s unwavering commitment to cultivating engi-\nneering skills and talent. In a report to the US govern-\nment, Dally and Su (2022) recommend that a portion of\nfunds be dedicated to creating a national microelectron-\nics training network for the future semiconductor work-\nforce. However, with few local graduates and unattrac-\ntive salaries, specialised semiconductor workers are in\nshort supply. Over the next 10 years, South Korea\u2019s semi-\nconductor industry is expected to face a shortage of\nat least 30,000 workers, according to the Korea Semi-\nconductor Industry Association9. Dynamic outsourcing\ncould be an alternative to localisation. Applying con-\ncepts from transaction cost economics, the resource-\nbased view, and dynamic capabilities view, Khan, Mann,\nand Peterson (2021) analyse the most important factors\nin the development of outsourcing, using the Delphi and\nanalytic hierarchy process method. Their research iden-\ntifies the most influential sub-factors in the development\nof outsourcing for back-end semiconductor equipment\ncompanies.\nCross-regional collaborations are now treated with\ngreat care. The White House acknowledges that the\nCreating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconduc-\ntors (CHIPS) Act of 2022 \u2018will reduce our dependence\non critical technologies from China and other vulner-\nable or overly concentrated foreign supply chains\u201910.\nNordin and St\u00fcnkel (2022) report that following the\nannouncement of the European Chips Act in Febru-\nary 2022, the EU seeks to cooperate more closely with\nTaiwan on chip production. However, the Taiwanese\ngovernment seems to prefer a steady stream of smaller\nbut successful cooperation projects to ensure long-term\nengagement. The recent trade tensions between Japan\nand Korea also pose unique challenges, as they threaten\nthe availability of specialised and necessary chemicals\nthat are not easily substitutable without imports. Good-\nman, VerWey, and Kim (2019) argue that such risks are\nlikely to force companies in the industry to make seem-\ningly counter-intuitive investment and sourcing deci-\nsions related to specialised chemicals. This insight into\nthe chemical supply chain provides a valuable new per-\nspective for future research on the US\u2013China trade war.\nThe localisation of SSCs has been proposed as a way\nout of the global supply chain uncertainty. For exam-\nple, To (2021) suggests that localising supply chains may\nreduce China\u2019s reliance on foreign technology, but it\nwill be costly and commercially unviable. Peters (2022)\nfurther argues that significant changes in strategic eco-\nnomic and national security linked to the rise of China\nin an increasingly multipolar world mean that the US\nno longer occupies its post-war position as the sole\nsuperpower.\nThe global semiconductor value chain is a related\nresearch topic. Lee, Gao, and Li (2017) argue that a\nlatecomer country like China may find it difficult to\ndevelop a competitive semiconductor industry. Low-end\nsemiconductor markets cannot be easily distinguished\n12\nW. XIONG ET AL.\nfrom high-end markets, which means that they cannot\nbe leveraged by indigenous companies. These authors\nconclude that successful catching-up requires the growth\nof indigenous firms rather than dependence on for-\neign direct investment. Grimes and Du (2020) examine\nthe implications of China\u2019s current integration into the\nglobal semiconductor value chain and find that, even\nwith some movement up the value chain, such as the\nemergence of HiSilicon and general growth in the design\nsector, much of the higher value added activity in China\ncontinues to be dominated by major global companies.\nThey also argue that the current tensions between the\nUS and China have highlighted China\u2019s exposure to crit-\nical dependencies on foreign technology in semiconduc-\ntor development. The decoupling of international sup-\nply chains could negatively affect the future of China\u2019s\nsemiconductor industry.\nVerWey (2019) discusses China\u2019s current semicon-\nductor industrial policies. According to a recent report\nfrom the Office of the United States Trade Represen-\ntative (USTR), China\u2019s strategy is to create a closed-\nloop semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem with self-\nsufficiency at every stage of the manufacturing process,\nfrom integrated circuit design and manufacturing to\npackaging and testing, and the production of related\nmaterials and equipment11. To achieve this goal, certain\nChinese policies have the potential to (1) force the cre-\nation of market demand for indigenous semiconductor\nproducts, (2) gradually restrict or block market access\nto foreign semiconductor products as competing domes-\ntic products emerge, (3) force technology transder, and\n(4) grow non-market based domestic capacity, thereby\ndisrupting the fabric of the global semiconductor value\nchain12.\nThe US government support\u2019s policies for the semi-\nconductor industry have also undergone tremendous\nchanges (Jeong 2022). Since 2020, legislation to provide\ncomprehensive support with a substantial budget has\nbeen introduced, promoting cooperation with Congress.\nIn June 2020, the bill for the CHIPS for America Act\nwas drafted, with the aim of funding R&D and secure\ntechnology supply chains to revive the domestic semi-\nconductor manufacturing industry. This was followed by\nthe American Foundations Act of 2020, aimed at provid-\ning subsidies to promote the expansion of semiconductor\nmanufacturing facilities. The two bills were included in\nthe United States Innovation and Competition Act of\n2021 in June 2021 and passed by the Senate. Khan (2020)\nconcludes that the US\u2019s export controls on semicon-\nductor technology were relaxed in 2018, leading to an\nexpansion of exports to China, particularly exports of\nSMEs and chips. However, the US has recently tightened\nits export licencing policies and applied stricter controls\non military end-uses and end-users, as well as on other\nmajor Chinese entities.\n4. Disruption of public health events\n4.1. Public health events as a disruptive force\nPublic health events, such as infectious disease outbreaks,\nhave the potential to disrupt global supply chains on\na scale that challenges SSC viability. For example, the\nCOVID-19 pandemic had significant impacts on the SSC,\ncausing disruptions in production and logistics and lead-\ning to shortages in the industry. It also led to an increased\ndemand for electronic devices, causing strain in the sup-\nply chain and leading to increased pricese (Albrecht and\nSteinr\u00fccke 2020) and reduced availability of certain prod-\nucts. In this section, we first summarise how the pan-\ndemic influenced the SCC and then classify the literature\naccording to related topics (Table 6).\n4.2. Impact of public health event on the\nsemiconductor supply chain\nThe SSC was profoundly affected by the COVID-\n19 pandemic, with several challenges straining that\nstrained industry operations. We summarise the key\nresearch questions and possible mitigation strategies in\nthe selected literature and then identify some possible\nresearch gaps (Figure 6).\nOne of the major hurdles during the COVID-19 pan-\ndemic was the occurrence of production disruptions\ncaused by various factors. Because of supply shortages\nand restrictions, many semiconductor manufacturing\nfacilities were forced to close or operate at reduced capac-\nity. This led to a decrease in production and a slowdown\nin meeting demand. With a multi-tier supply chain, the\nsemiconductor industry relies on a complex network of\nsuppliers, and disruptions in any part of the supply chain\ncan lead to shortages of crucial components needed for\nchip manufacturing, causing ripple effects throughout\nthe supply chain (Ivanov and Dolgui 2022a). For instance,\nrestrictions at one of the busiest ports in Yantian, south-\nern China, led to delays in loading and unloading cargo\n(Ramani, Ghosh, and Sodhi 2022).\nPublic health events can also affect consumer demand\nand behaviour. In times of uncertainty and crisis, con-\nsumer spending patterns may change, leading to changes\nin demand for semiconductor products. For example,\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for electronic\ndevices and communication technologies increased due\nto the rise of remote work and online activities. Mean-\nwhile, demand for certain applications, such as automo-\ntive or consumer electronics, may have decreased because\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH\n13\nTable 6.

Marinova and Bitri (2021) study the solutions\noffered by the semiconductor industry and the initiatives\nimplemented by Europe, the US, and especially China\nto help their countries and companies adapt to the chip\nshortage in the post pandemic years.\nLogistical delays were also a major concern during\nthis period. Ports were congested because of a mas-\nsive influx of goods, leading to container availability\nissues. Moreover, shipping routes experienced disrup-\ntions and traffic jams, creating further delays in the trans-\nportation of semiconductor products. Ishak et al. (2022)\nargue that supply chain adaptive strategies combining\nrobustness, agility, and resilience had a significant impact\non the performance of semiconductor companies dur-\ning the COVID-19 pandemic. From a broader perspec-\ntive, Ivanov and Dolgui (2021) review recent operations\nresearch studies dealing with disruption propagation and\nstructural dynamics in supply chains, with a focus on\nmathematical modelling methods. Oraby et al. (2021)\ndiscuss lockdown scenarios in representative countries\nand note that increasing rates of social contact can all\nbenefit from well-timed lockdown interventions.\nThe pandemic also triggered other disruptions in\nthe SCC, particularly concerning labour-related issues.\nInfectious diseases outbreaks can lead to employee\nabsences, labour shortages, and restrictions on the per-\nsonnel movement. Labour shortages and strikes affected\nthe workforce during the pandemic, resulting in reduced\nproduction capacity and difficulty meeting demand. Pan-\ndemic outbreaks in Taiwan and South Korea affected\nplant production by causing labour shortages. In short,\nthe pandemic exacerbated an existing talent shortage\nproblem. The Taiwan office of photolithography systems\n14\nW. XIONG ET AL.\nsupplier ASML Holding NV\u2019s said that it was forced to\ncontact second-tier universities and colleges in Taiwan\nand abroad to address talent shortages, as job poaching\nis not a long-term solution13.\nOverall, the pandemic had far-reaching effects on the\nSSC, causing major disruptions in production, demand,\nlogistics, and labour. These disruptions led to shortages,\nlonger lead times, and increased costs for many industries\nreliant on semiconductors.\n4.3. Recovery of the semiconductor industry from\ndisruptions caused by public health events\nIn general, government policies following public health\nevents help to boost the recovery process. Elia et al. (2021)\nsuggest that reshoring policies must be supported by and\ncombined with industrial policies to strengthen the com-\npetitiveness and sustainability of production systems.\nAlthough production has gradually resumed since the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, Cai and Luo (2020) report that\nbusiness has been difficult for many SMEs because of the\nslowdown of the global economy. Since the COVID-19\noutbreak, these companies have faced increased risks of\nbankruptcy, and if these risks worsen, a systemic financial\ncrisis could occur. This suggests that governments should\ntake steps to control the bankruptcy risks of SMEs, as they\nprovide for most jobs.\nDemand fluctuations are challenging problems in the\npost-pandemic semiconductor industry. Although Bauer\net al. (2020) expected overall demand to be 5%\u201315%\nlower in 2020 than in 2019, Gartner Inc.14 later verified\nthat global semiconductor revenue in 2020 was US$466.2\nbillion, an increase of 10.4% compared to 2019. Chien,\nLin, and Lin (2020) propose a novel UNISON rein-\nforcement learning framework, focussing on the realistic\nneeds of a leading distributor of semiconductor com-\nponents and modules, to dynamically select the opti-\nmal demand forecasting model for specific products with\ncorresponding demand patterns.\nConsumer tastes and behaviours can also differ con-\nsiderably during and after a public health event. For\ninstance, Barnes, Diaz, and Arnaboldi (2021) report that\nconsumer behaviour during the pandemic was charac-\nterised by \u2018panic buying\u2019. Using big data from social\nmedia, these authors apply text mining and compen-\nsatory control theory to demonstrate early warnings of\npotential demand issues. Similar research topics and\nmethodologies can shed light on semiconductor end-use\nconsumption. An unexpectedly rapid economic recov-\nery (Panwar, Pinkse, and Marchi 2022) has worsened an\nalready unbalanced situation in terms of demand and\nsupply of semiconductors.\nAuto chips are considered an important asset of the\npost-pandemic semiconductor industry. Indeed, auto\nmanufacturers rely haevily on semiconductor chips for\nvarious functions in vehicles, such as advanced driver\nassistance systems, infotainment systems, and engine\ncontrol units. Assuming that governments would offer\nincentives to car buyers in 2020, Bauer et al. (2020)\nestimate that the automotive industry would experience\nyear-over-year growth of 28%\u201336% in 2021, which was\nan optimistic recovery scenario. According to a report\npublished by Global Market Insight15, the automotive\nelectronics market was worth more than US$270 bil-\nlion in 2017 and is expected to exceed US$390 billion\nin 2024, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)\nof more than 6.5% (Ahmad 2020). Towards the sec-\nond half of 2020, as the automotive industry ramped up\nproduction, it ran into a significant obstacle: a shortage\nof semiconductor chips. Increased demand for automo-\nbiles led to the demand for these chips, creating a ripple\neffect upstream in the SSC. However, chip manufacturers\nfaced limited manufacturing capacities and were unable\nto meet the sudden surge in demand from the auto-\nmotive industry. This prolonged unavailability of chips\ncaused a shortage, disrupting the automotive industry\u2019s\nproduction plans.\nAuto manufacturers were forced to halt or postpone\ntheir production decisions because of the shortage of crit-\nical components16. The impact of the chip shortage rever-\nberated across the entire automotive industry, leading to\nproduction halts, backlogs, and potential loss of revenue.\nSeveral auto manufacturers had to reduce or adjust their\nproduction schedules, which affected their ability to meet\nconsumer demand and fulfil orders. The shortage also\nhighlighted the vulnerability of the automotive supply\nchain and the need for more robust strategies to manage\ndisruptions and ensure a stable supply of semiconduc-\ntor chips. Ramani, Ghosh, and Sodhi (2022) summarise\nsystemic disruptions in supply chains by studying the\nchip shortage in the automotive industry. They also test\na stylised mathematical programming model with one\nchip supplier and three manufacturers to determine the\nimpact of some of the identified factors and they find that\nshortages propagate within and across sectors.\n5. Discussion\n5.1. Future research areas\nThe SSC, essential to the global economy, faces both chal-\nlenges and opportunities for innovation and enhanced\nresilience. As we move forward, several emerging trends\nand strategic directions are shaping the future of this\nINTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRODUCTION RESEARCH\n15\ncritical industry. Our review of SCC vulnerabilities and\ndisruptions identified several research gaps.\n(1) Geopolitical considerations and resilient design of\nsupply chain networks. According to Aldrighetti\net al. (2021) and Shih (2020), there is a need to\nre-evaluate the extent and nature of globalisation\nof supply chains. Geopolitical dynamics, particu-\nlarly with regard to China, play a major role in\nshaping the future of the SSC. As China seeks to\nreduce its dependence on Western technology, the\nglobal semiconductor industry must navigate the\nchallenges of technology transfer and national secu-\nrity risks17. Strategies for managing these risks (Kuo\net al. 2023) include diversifying supply chains and\nusing additional restrictions and subsidies to incen-\ntivise companies to reduce their exposure to geopo-\nlitical uncertainties. Future studies could investi-\ngate the trade-offs between global diversification and\nlocalised supply chains, considering factors such as\ngeopolitical risks, trade barriers, and local economic\nincentives.\n(2) Decentralised supply chain models for enhanced\nresilience. Koh, Dolgui, and Sarkis (2020) show that\nthe decentralised framework of blockchain technol-\nogy (DiMase et al. 2016; Xu et al. 2019; Rekha et al.\n2021; Calzada et al. 2023; Tan et al. 2023) miti-\ngates risks and disruptions in transport and logistics.\nFuture research should focus on the design of decen-\ntralised supply chain networks, leveraging insights\nfrom the burgeoning field of blockchain studies,\nas suggested by Pournader et al. (2020) and Yang\net al. (2023). This is particularly important for the\nsemiconductor industry, which is characterised by\nlong lead times and complex global networks. The\npotential of blockchain to address these unique chal-\nlenges offers a promising method for enhancing SSC\nresilience.\n(3) Strategic responses to supply chain disruptions. In\nlight of the recent disruptions discussed above, the\nsemiconductor industry is focussing on strategic\nresponses (Ishak et al. 2023) to enhance its resilience\nand agility. Simulating (Chen et al. 2017) and plan-\nning for extreme supply and demand disruptions\nhas become a priority, as has re-evaluating just-in-\ntime inventory strategies18. Creating digital twins\nfor critical parts of the supply chain (Seok, Cai,\nand Park 2021; Nguyen et al. 2023) allows for bet-\nter simulation and testing of scenarios, enabling\nfaster and more informed responses to unforeseen\nevents. Other approaches such as the fast chain\nmodels and flexible models, are aimed at indus-\ntries that need to respond quickly respond to market\ntrends or seasonal fluctuations in demand19. Future\nresearch on these strategic responses, such as agility\nand increased data sharing with suppliers20, could\nprovide insights to enhance the ability to respond\nquickly to disruptions.\n(4) Digitalization and Industry 4.0 for supply chain\nresilience. The adoption of Industry 4.0 technolo-\ngies (Ivanov, Dolgui, and Sokolov 2019; MacCarthy\nand Ivanov 2022) plays a crucial role in mitigating\nSSC disruptions by equipping supply chain planners\nwith advanced capabilities for enhanced decision-\nmaking. Digitalization tools such as IoT (Ben-Daya,\nHassini, and Bahroun 2019; Oi et al. 2022); AI\n(Baryannis et al. 2019; Gopal et al. 2022); and big\ndata analytics (Rai et al. 2021; Alizadeh et al. 2020;\nChang et al. 2022; Jahani et al. 2023) enable real-\ntime monitoring and predictive analytics, leading\nto proactive management of potential disruptions.\nFor instance, simulation optimisation techniques\n(Hartwick et al. 2023; Zhang et al. 2020) applied\nto production scheduling can significantly improve\noperational efficiencies and adaptability (Ghasemi\net al. 2024). These technologies facilitate a more agile\nresponse to unforeseen changes in semiconductor\nsupply and demand, improving overall supply chain\nresilience. This review underscores the necessity of\nexploring the impact of digital technologies in cre-\nating robust SSC systems, especially under the pres-\nsures of geopolitical issues, disrupted globalisation\nand market volatility. Researchers are encouraged\nto delve into recent reviews and studies, such as\nGhasemi et al. (2024) and M\u00f6nch et al. (2020), which\nprovide comprehensive insights into the application\nand benefits of these advanced technologies in mod-\nern SSC.\n5.2. Academic implications\nBuilding on previous research, this study contributes to\nthe analysis of supply chain resilience and disruptions in\nthe semiconductor industry. First, we provide a compre-\nhensive and timely review of the literature and summarise\nthe proposed mitigation strategies. We also identify sev-\neral key research gaps. For instance, it is surprising that\nthe topics of IP, hardware, software, and raw materi-\nals (Chakrabarti et al. 2022), which are essential to the\nprocessing of semiconductor products, are not addressed\nin the literature. Furthermore, little is known about the\neffect of the lack of R&D and design professionals on\nthe SSC. Addressing the lack of such key elements is\neven more important in the face of disruptions such as\ngeopolitical issues.\n16\nW. XIONG ET AL.\nSecond, for more general interest and multidisci-\nplinary insights, our review identifies and collects addi-\ntional sources of literature from closely related domains\nsuch as international trade, industrial organisation, polit-\nical science, human resource management, and global\nstrategies (Frost and Hua 2019). These valuable com-\nplementary publications enrich the current stream of\nresearch on supply chain disruption. Given the com-\nplex and global nature of the SSC, future research should\ninvestigate how mitigation strategies in the face of dis-\nruptions can be adapted to and scaled across different\nenvironments, cultures, and economies to ensure broad\napplicability and effectiveness.\nThe trend towards the localisation of the semiconduc-\ntor industry and other critical industries, driven by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, raises questions about its long-\nterm impact on global innovation ecosystems, supply\nchain resilience, and geopolitical dynamics. The evolv-\ning geopolitical landscape also presents a complex web\nof risks for global industries. Thus, research is needed\nto develop more sophisticated models for assessing and\nmanaging geopolitical risks, particularly in sectors crit-\nical to national security and economic stability. This\nincludes understanding the interplay between national\npolicies, international relations, and industry strategies.\n5.3. Practical implications\nTo combat SSC vulnerabilities, governments, industries,\nand organisations could deploy various strategies aimed\nat enhancing SSC resilience. These efforts can mitigate\nrisks of disruption, whether from geopolitical conflicts,\ntechnological shifts, or public health events.\nGovernments around the world have recognised the\nstrategic importance of semiconductors and have imple-\nmented several measures to secure and strengthen their\nsupply chains. One notable approach is the implementa-\ntion of market-driven incentive programmes designed to\ngeographically diversify the semiconductor manufactur-\ning base. For instance, the US has proposed a US$50 bil-\nlion incentive programme that is expected to double the\ncountry\u2019s advanced semiconductor manufacturing capa-\nbilities over the next decade21. Such initiatives aim not\nonly to bolster domestic localised manufacturing but also\nto mitigate risks related to geopolitical tensions and trade\nbarriers (Ochonogor et al. 2023). Moreover, governments\nare urged to promote global trade and international col-\nlaboration in R&D and technology standards, as well as to\nencourage public investment in science and engineering\neducation and to reform immigration policies to attract\nglobal talent22.\nPolicymakers also play a critical role in shaping\nthe environment in which the semiconductor industry\noperates to combat disruptions. It is recommended that\npolicies aim not for complete self-sufficiency but rather\nfor nuanced and targeted approaches that strengthen sup-\nply chain resilience. This includes ensuring a global level\nplaying field, protecting IP rights, and avoiding broad\nunilateral restrictions on technology and suppliers. In\naddition, our review calls for policies that address the\ntalent shortage and stimulate upstream innovation.\nOn the industry front, companies are actively look-\ning for ways to make their supply chains more resilient,\nadopting various frameworks and mitigation strategies.\nFor instance, this includes the development and align-\nment of technology blocks among major players in the\nsemiconductor industry to ensure compatibility through-\nout the value chain23. Additionally, out literature review\nreveals that a shift towards an agile supply chain net-\nwork model is a critical strategy. Such a model facilitates\nmultiple pathways for supply chain operations, effectively\nreducing the risk of single points of failure and enabling\na balance between cost efficiency and resilience24.\n5.4. Limitations\nThis study has certain limitations. First, it only cov-\ners the literature from the past 17 years, drawn from a\nkey electronic academic database (i.e. Scopus) and man-\nual searches from Google Scholar. Second, the articles\nselected for review and analysis are mainly limited to\npeer-reviewed academic journals, which generally pro-\nvide high quality content. Other types of texts, such as\nconference papers and reports, are difficult to evaluate\nand thus conference papers are less included. However,\ncollecting data from more sources could lead to a better\nunderstanding of this topic.\nNotes\n1. https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/10/tech/taiwan-chip-short\nage-covid-climate-crisis-intl-hnk/index.html.\n2. https://kpmg.com/ua/en/home/insights/2022/05/russia-uk\nraine-war-impact-semiconductor-industry.html.\n3. https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/vws-wolfsburg\n-output-hit-chip-problems.\n4. https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-18/sh\nortage-of-legacy-chips-keeping-ford-ceo-up-at-night.\n5. https://www.investopedia.com/semiconductors-supply-ch\nain-7367716.\n6.
