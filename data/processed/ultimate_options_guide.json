Nevertheless, they made their debut in \nthe U.S. after the Chicago Board of Trade was founded, in 1848, to organize commodities trading \nactivities. These markets introduced futures and opened the doors for many new financial instruments \nincluding options. In this chapter, we will explain the basics of how options work and how they are usually \nemployed in today\u2019s modern financial markets. \n \nAn option is a contract between two parties giving the taker (buyer) the right, but not the obligation, to \nbuy or sell a security at a predetermined price on or before a predetermined date. To acquire this right, \nthe taker pays a premium to the writer (seller) of the contract. \n \nCALL OPTIONS \n \nA call option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a \ncertain underlying asset at a certain price, known as the strike price. \n \nFor example, ABC Corporation is trading at $120. A one-month call option is trading for $3.50. \n \nThe buyer of this call option has the right, but not the obligation to buy 100 shares of ABC for $120 per \nshare at any time during the life of the contract. For this right, the buyer of the contract pays $3.50 to \nthe seller. \n \nThe seller of the contract receives and keeps the $3.50 but is obligated to deliver 100 shares at $120 if \ncalled upon to do so. \n \nPUT OPTIONS \n \nIn turn, a put option is a financial contract that gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to sell \na certain underlying asset at the strike price on or before expiry. \n \nUsing the example of ABC Corporation trading at $120, a one-month put option is trading at $4.00. \n \nThe buyer of this put option has the right, but not the obligation to sell 100 shares of ABC for $120 per \nshare at any time during the life of the contract. \n \nFor this right, the buyer of the put contract pays $4.00 to the seller. \n \nThe seller of the contract receives and keeps the $4.00 but is obligated to buy 100 shares at $120 if called \nupon to do so. \n \nRIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS \n \nThe fact that the individual or institution who holds the option has the right and not the obligation to \nexercise the derivative means that if the result of the operation turns out to be unprofitable, the holder \ncan abstain from completing the transaction and his sole loss would be the premium paid to purchase \nthe option. \n \nOn the other hand, if the holder does exercise the option, the seller of the option must fulfill the contract. \n \n \n \nWhy Use Options \n \nOptions can be used for four main purposes: \n \n\uf0b7 Hedging/Risk Management \n\uf0b7 Leverage \n\uf0b7 Income \n\uf0b7 Speculation \n \nHEDGING / RISK MANAGEMENT \n \nOptions are a fantastic tool for hedging exposure to a certain asset. Let\u2019s say an investor has a portfolio \nof S&P500 stocks and is concerned about a drop in their value over the next few months. \n \nBuying an SPX put option would give the investor some downside protection. If the S&P500 falls, the \nvalue of the investors stock portfolio will drop, but he will have made some profits from the bought put \nwhich will help offset the losses. \n \nThis is a simple example and there are many different ways in which options can be used for hedging \nand risk management. \n \nLEVERAGE \n \nSince options cost only a small fraction of the price of the underlying asset an investor can gain a larger \nexposure to a certain security by buying put or call options instead of buying the underlying asset \ndirectly. This particular feature of options is known as leverage. \n \nLet\u2019s say you want to invest in ABC Corporation stock, as you think the price of its shares will go up over \nthe next 3 months. If you have $1,000 and the shares cost $50 you could only buy 20 shares. \n \nInstead, you could buy 2 call option contracts for $500 that give you the right to buy 100 ABC Corporation \nshares at $50, 3 months from now. \n \nIf the price of ABC\u2019s shares goes up to $60 you will earn a 20% return if you invested in the shares directly. \n \nAt expiry, the $50 call option would be worth $10 with the underlying stock trading at $50. In this case, \nthe call option has achieved a 100% return. \n \nHowever, leverage cuts both ways and if the stock doesn\u2019t move as expected, the investor could lose \n100% of their investment. \n \nINCOME \n \nUsing options to generate income is a popular strategy with investors. Covered calls are a logical place \nfor stock investors to start because it is an easy scenario to understand. \n \nInvestors who sell call options on shares they own, can produce an income in addition to any dividends \nearned. \n \nBy selling a call option, the investor gets to keep the option premium, but there is a possibility that the \nshares will get called away if the stock price rises above the strike price of the sold call. \n \nCovered calls will be covered in more detail shortly. \n \nOther investors will use options to generate income on shares they have no ownership of via more \nadvanced strategies such as vertical spreads, iron condors, calendar spreads and butterflies. \n \nSPECULATION \n \nMany investors and traders will use options to speculate on the market. Those expecting the market to \nrise might buy call options in the hope of making a large potential return. \n \nThose expecting the market to drop might buy put options. \n \nOther traders may opt for income generating strategies. \n \nThe great thing about options is that there are many strategies that can be used, no matter what your \nmarket outlook or opinion. \n \nOption Features \n \nIn this chapter, we\u2019ll take a look at the seven basic characteristics of all option contracts: \n \n\uf0b7 Underlying Asset \n\uf0b7 Call vs Put \n\uf0b7 Contract Size \n\uf0b7 Expiration Date \n\uf0b7 Strike Price \n\uf0b7 Premium \n\uf0b7 American Vs European \n \nUNDERLYING ASSET \n \nAs we know, the definition of an option is that it is a contract giving the owner (buyer) of the option \nthe right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell a defined quantity of a defined asset. This asset is called \nthe underlying asset or sometimes just underlying. \n \nOptions can be traded on many different underlying assets, particularly in the United States and the \nuniverse of underlying assets has expanded rapidly in the last five to ten years. \n \nThe most common underlying assets are common stocks (shares in companies trading on the stock \nexchange). \n \nOther popular assets for option traders include indexes such as the S&P 500, Nasdaq and Russell 2000. \nThe Russell 2000 is a particular favorite with option traders because of the high volatility, high liquidity \nand 10 point strikes. \n \nOptions can also be traded on futures, bonds, interest rates, currencies and ETF\u2019s. \n \nCALL VS PUT \n \nThere are two basic types of options \u2013 call options and put options. As a reminder \n \nA call option gives you the right, but not obligation, to buy the underlying asset. \n \nA put option gives you the right, but not obligation, to sell the underlying asset. \n \nCONTRACT SIZE \n \nAn options contract represents exposure to a number of underlying shares. The standard contract size \nis generally 100. \n \nThis can occasionally change if there is a corporate action such as a reorganization or a new issuance of \nshares. \n \nIn the case of an index option, the contract value is fixed at a certain number of dollars per index point. \nThe size of the contract is equal to the index level x the dollar value per index point. For example, \nS&P500 (SPX) options have a value of $100, so for an option contract with a strike price of 2,800, one \ncontract would be 2,800 x 100 = 280,000. \n \nEXPIRATION DATE \n \nOptions have a limited life span and expire on a certain date. The expiration date is the day on which \nall unexercised options expire and can no longer be traded. The expiration date is fixed during the life \nof an option and will not change. Any options that are not exercised before expiration become \nworthless. \n \nThe expiration date for listed stock options in the United States is normally the third Friday of the \ncontract month or the month that the contract expires. On months that the Friday falls on a holiday, \nthe expiration date is on the Thursday immediately before the third Friday1. \n \nSome brokers will automatically exercise any options that are in-the-money by more than $0.01. If a \ntrader doesn\u2019t want the option to be exercised, they should close out the position prior to expiration. \n \nEuropean style monthly Index options also expire on a third Friday of the month, however the last \ntrading day for Index options is the Thursday. This can result in a significantly different settlement price \nthan the Thursday closing price. You can read here for more details. \n \nIn the last few years there has been an explosion in the number of weekly options available. In some \nunderlying instruments like SPX, there are options expiring every few days. \n \n \n1 Investopedia: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/expirationdate.asp \nSTRIKE PRICE \n \nThe strike price is the predetermined price for buying or selling the underlying asset. \n \nThe strike price does not change through the life of the option unless there is a corporation action such \nas a reorganization. \n \nDepending on the underlying asset, there are usually many different strike prices available. \n \nTaking a quick look at SPY options for the next month\u2019s expiration date shows strike prices available \nfrom $140 to $225 in 5-point intervals then from $225 to $325 in 1-point intervals, then again from \n$325 to $400 in 5-point intervals. \n \nCompare that to a less popular underlying asset like IYT and we have $155 to $175 in 5-point intervals, \nthen $175 to $200 in 1-point intervals and $200 to $220 in 5-point intervals. \n \nPREMIUM \n \nThe premium is the price of the option which is determined by the buyer and seller of the option. \nOption premium is determined by market participants with market makers playing a huge role in \ndetermining the price of options. \n \nYou can read more about the role of market makers here. \n \nOption premiums are quoted in cents per share. To calculate the total premium cost, traders need to \ntake the price in cents times the multiplier. An option contract quoted at $1.20 would cost $120 to buy \n($1.20 x 100). \n \nOption premiums are higher for high volatility stocks which reflects the chance of higher movement in \nthe underlying over the course of the options life. \n \nFor example, an at-the-money call option on a high volatility stock like ROKU trades for around $14.00 \nwhereas a similar call on a low volatility stock like JNJ trades for around $4.00. \n \nOption premium will also depend on the price of the underlying stock. A stock like AMZN which is \ncurrently trading at $1720 has at-the-money options trading around $65. \n \nCompare that to a low-price stock like GE which is trading at $8.30 where at-the-money options trade \nfor only $0.20 - $0.30. \n \nAMERICAN VS EUROPEAN \n \nThe difference between American and European options relates to when the owner of the option can \nexercise the option. American style options can be exercised at any point during the options life, but a \nEuropean style option can only be exercised at a single point in its life \u2013 the moment it expires. \n \nExercising an option has nothing to do with trading an option and both style of options trade exactly \nthe same way during their lifetime. \n \nThe terms American and European have nothing to do with geographic locations. Both types of options \ntrade in many places. European style options are very common on American exchanges (SPX, RUT and \nNDX are all European style options). \n \nUse Cases of Options \n \nLet\u2019s look at some practical examples of how you can make options work for you. \n \nINCOME GENERATION \n \nSelling call options against shares already owned is one of the simplest and most rewarding ways to trade \noptions. It\u2019s a great way to get started for those that are new to options. \n \nIt\u2019s a logical place to start if you\u2019re familiar with share ownership. \n \nSelling options over shares you own, generates income in additional to any dividends earned while holding the \nshares. The risk of course, is that your shares might get called away if they rise strongly. You are also limited \nyour upside because any gains the stock makes above the strike price are not captured. \n \nLet\u2019s look at a couple of examples: \n \nSCENARIO 1: SELLING OPTIONS ON SHARES YOU ALREADY OWN \n \nAssume you already hold 100 shares of ABC Corporation as part of a diversified long-term retirement portfolio. \n \nThe current price is $60 and you would be happy to sell your shares if the price reached $62.50. You look in your \nbrokerage account and see that a 3-month $62.50 call option is trading with a bid price of $0.98 and an ask price \nof $1.02. \n \n You place an order to sell the $62.50 call option for $1.00 which is the mid-point of the bid-ask spread. \n \nAssuming your order gets filled, you will receive $100 in premium ($1.00 x 100 shares in the contract) which is \nyours to keep. \n \nAs an option seller, you now have the obligation to sell your shares for $62.50 if called upon to do so at any time \nduring the life of the option. \n \nIf ABC Corporation is trading above $62.50 at expiry, your shares will be called away and you will have made a \nnice profit. \n \nIF ABC Corporation is trading below $62.50 at expiry, you get to keep your shares, and the $100 option income. \nYou can now continue to hold the shares or sell a new call option. \n \nSCENARIO 2: SELLING A PUT OPTION ON A STOCK YOU ARE HAPPY TO OWN \n \nIn this example, you don\u2019t own any ABC Corporation shares, but would be happy to buy them for $57.50. \n \nUpon checking the option quotes, you see that a 3-month $57.50 put option on ABC Corporation is trading with \na bid price of $1.12 and an ask price of $1.16. \n \nYou place an order to sell the $57.50 put option for $1.14. \n \nAssuming your order is filled, you receive $114 in premium. \n \nYou now have the obligation to buy 100 shares of ABC Corporation at $57.50 if called upon to do so during the \nlife of the option. \n \nIf ABC Corporation is trading above $57.50 at expiry, your put option expires worthless and you have generated \n$114 in income. \n \nIf ABC Corporation is trading below $57.50, your put option will be assigned and you will be required to buy 100 \nshares at $57.50. \n \nThe net cost of the purchase is $56.36 which is calculated as the strike price less the premium received ($57.50 - \n$1.14). \n \nSelling put options is a great way to take ownership of shares you want to buy for a lower cost price. \n \nThe downside is that $114 is the maximum profit you can make, no matter how high ABC Corporation\u2019s shares \ngo. \n \nPORTFOLIO PROTECTION \n \nOptions are a fantastic way to protect against a short-term fall in a stock\u2019s price without having to sell your \nshares. \n \nSelling call options was covered under income generation and does give some small protection against a drop in \na stock\u2019s price, but the protection is limited to the amount of premium received. \n \nAny further falls are not protected. \n \nA way to obtain more protection is by buying a put option. \n \nUsing ABC Corporation again, the stock is trading at $60 and you are worried about a sharp decline. You want to \nlock in a sale price in case things get really bad. \n \nInstead of selling the 3-month $57.50 put option as in the previous example, this time we buy the put option. \n \nThe put option costs $1.14 or $114 in total and we have a guaranteed sale price of $57.50, no matter how low \nthe stock goes. \n \nEven if the company goes bankrupt and the share price goes to $0, you can still sell you shares for $57.50. \n \nYou can see why options are such a great tool for portfolio protection! \n \nThink of buying a put like buying an insurance contract. You pay a premium and receive coverage in the event of \na disaster. \n \nIf the disaster doesn\u2019t happen, you lose the premium that you paid, but you don\u2019t mind because you were able \nto sleep at night knowing that you had protection against the worst-case scenario. \n \nLEVERAGED EXPOSURE \n \nSpeculators can choose to try and profit by predicting movements in the underlying shares. Traders can achieve \nfar greater returns using options as opposed to just buying or selling shares. \n \nBuying call options allows traders to profit from an increase in the price of the underlying asset. \n \nBuying 100 shares can be prohibitively expensive for some investors but buying call options allows traders to \nleverage their capital to potentially achieve higher returns. \n \nThe flip side with leverage of course is the higher risk and when buying call options, there is always a chance that \nthe investor will lose 100% of their investment. \n \nHere\u2019s a table comparing the potential returns from share ownership and call options. \n \n \n \nNotice that the gains in dollar terms are similar, but the percentage returns are much higher for the call option. \n \nBuying call options can also be thought of in terms of buying time to decide if you want to buy the shares. \n \nYou pay the premium which is only a fraction of the price of the underlying shares. The option then locks in a \nbuying price for the shares if you decide to exercise your option. \n \nADVANCED STRATEGIES \n \nSelling call options and buying calls and puts are simple strategies to get started in options trading. \n \nHowever, the possibilities are almost endless and there are many ways to trade different market opinions. \n \nThis include advanced strategies such as: \n \n\uf0b7 \nIron Condors \n\uf0b7 \nRatio Spreads \n\uf0b7 \nCalendar Spreads \n\uf0b7 \nDiagonal Spreads \n\uf0b7 \nPoor Man\u2019s Covered Call \n\uf0b7 \nWheel Trade \n\uf0b7 \nStrangles and Straddles \n\uf0b7 \nRisk Reversal \n\uf0b7 \nDouble Diagonals \n\uf0b7 \nJade Lizard \n\uf0b7 \nTrapdoor \n \nOnce you understand the basics, the wonderful world of options starts to open all new possibilities. \n \nOption Pricing \n \nOption prices are determined by mathematical models such as the Black-Scholes or Binomial pricing models. \nMost traders do not have a thorough understanding of these models and to be honest, they don\u2019t need to. The \nmain thing to understand is that there are six key factors that determine an options price: \n \n\uf0b7 \nCurrent price of the underlying asset \n\uf0b7 \nThe time to expiration \n\uf0b7 \nThe strike price of the option \n\uf0b7 \nThe level of implied volatility \n\uf0b7 \nInterest rates \n\uf0b7 \nAny dividends payable during the life of the option \n \nBefore we look at the six factors, let\u2019s discuss Intrinsic Value and Extrinsic Value (Time Value). \n \nINTRINSIC VALUE \n \nIntrinsic value is the difference between the strike price of the options and the current price of the underlying \nasset. \n \nIt is the portion of an option\u2019s price that is not lost due to the passage of time. \n \nCALL OPTION INTRINSIC VALUE \n \nThe intrinsic value of a call option can be calculated as the underlying asset price minus the call strike price. \n \nLet\u2019s say ABC Corporation is trading at $105 and a $100 call option is trading for $7. This call option has intrinsic \nvalue of $5, calculated at $105 - $100. The remaining $2 is time value or extrinsic value. \n \nIf we had a $110 call option trading for $0.50, it would have $0 intrinsic value because the call option is out-of-\nthe-money. $105 minus $110 is less than zero so there is zero intrinsic value and the option price is made up \nentirely of time value. \n \nPUT OPTION INTRINSIC VALUE \n \nFor a put option the intrinsic value is calculated as the put strike price minus the price of the underlying asset. \n \nIn our ABC example, a put with a strike price of $110 would have $5 of intrinsic value ($110 - $105) and a put \nwith a strike price of $95 would have zero intrinsic value and be made up entirely of time value. \n \nTIME VALUE OF OPTIONS \n \nTime value of an option is the amount of the option premium that is not made up of intrinsic value. \n \nTime value is calculated as the option price minus the intrinsic value. \n \nThe longer in time until an options expiry, the greater the time value. \n \nTime value represents the amount you are prepared to pay for the possibility of the market moving in your \nfavour during the life of the option. \n \nTime value will vary between in-the-money, at-the-money and out-of-the-money options and is highest for at-\nthe-money options. \n \nOut-of-the-money options are comprised entirely of time value. \n \nDeep in-the-money options will be made up of mostly intrinsic value and will have very little time value. \n \nAs time draws closer to expiry, the chance of a favourable movement in the underlying asset declines and \ntherefore the time value declines. \n \nThis erosion of time value is called time decay. Time decay picks up speed as expiration approaches. Some of \nyou may have seen a similar chart to this: \n \n \nImage Credit: CME Group \n \n \nTIME VALUE AND VOLATILITY \n \nTime value is very much impacted by the anticipated level of volatility during the options life. A highly volatility \nstock will have much larger time value than a low volatility stock. \n \nThis represents the increased chance that the volatile stock will make a big move during the options life. \n \nAt the time of writing ROKU, a high-flying tech stock with high volatility was trading around the same price as \nProctor and Gamble a stable low volatility stock in the consumer goods sector. \n \nROKU implied volatility is around 88% and PG implied volatility is at 22%, as a result we would expect ROKU \noptions to be MUCH more expensive. \n \nFrom the two tables below, it\u2019s clear to see that ROKU options have much higher time value across the board. \n \nAs ROKU is a much more volatile underlying asset than PG, there is a much greater chance that the stock will \nmake a big move during the next 31 days and this is reflected in the option prices. \n \nFor example, the $105 strike puts are almost worthless at only $0.30 for PG, this reflects the fact that market \nparticipants think there is very little chance of PG reaching this level before expiry. \n \nThe ROKU $105 put on the other hand is valued at $5.30 showing that the market thinks there is a good chance \nthat ROKU might reach that level before expiry. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOPTION PRICING AND VOLATILITY \n \nAs we have seen above, the level of volatility can have a big impact on the prices of options, but how do we \nknow the volatility of an underlying asset? \n \nThere are two different types of volatility \u2013 historical volatility and implied volatility. \n \nHistorical Volatility is calculated by measuring an assets stocks past price movements. It is a known figure as it is \nbased on past data. \n \nThe data is readily available, so there is no need to calculate it yourself. The main point you need to know here is \nthat in general, stocks that have had large price swings in the past will have high levels of Historical Volatility. \n \nAs options traders, we are more interested in how volatile a stock is likely to be during the duration of our trade. \nHistorical Volatility will give some guide to how volatile a stock has been, but there is no way to predict future \nvolatility. \n \nThe best we can do is estimate it and this is where implied volatility comes in. \n \nImplied volatility is an estimate, made by professional traders and market makers of the future volatility of a \nstock. It is the only unknown factor in the options pricing model, because there is no way to know for certain \nhow volatile a stock will be in the future. The best we can do is estimate it based on past behaviour and current \nmarket events. \n \nImplied Volatility takes into account any events that are known to be occurring during the lifetime of the option \nwhich may have an impact on the price of the underlying stock. \n \nThis could include an earnings announcement or the release of drug trial results for a pharmaceutical company. \n \nThe current state of the general market is also incorporated into implied volatility estimates. If markets are calm, \nvolatility estimates are low, but during times of market stress volatility estimates will be raised. \n \nOne very simple way to keep an eye on the general market levels of volatility is to monitor the VIX Index. \n \nOPTION PRICING AND INTEREST RATES \n \nInterest rates also have an impact on option prices, however the impact is minimal and certainly much less than \nthe impact of volatility. \n \nShorter-term options are also less impacted by changes in interest rates. \n \nWhen interest rates rise, call option prices will increase while put option prices will decrease. \n \nThe logic behind this is as follows. Assume an investor wants to take an exposure to a particular stock. Instead of \nbuying the shares which might cost say $10,000, the investor buys call options total for $1,000. Buying the call \noptions gives a similar exposure and the remaining $9,000 can be invested to earn some interest. Higher interest \nrates mean higher income on the $9,000. This makes the call option more attractive and therefore more \nexpensive. \n \nThe opposite is true for put options. With high interest rates, put options are less attractive. This is because \nrather than holding the asset and buying a put option, the investor would be better off simply selling the asset \nand investing the proceeds at the higher interest rate. \n \nOPTION PRICING AND DIVIDENDS \n \nCash dividends affect option prices through their effect on the underlying stock price. Because the stock price is \nexpected to drop by the amount of the dividend on the ex-dividend date, high cash dividends imply lower call \npremiums and higher put premiums. \n \nOptions prices will anticipate the dividend amounts weeks and months in advance. \n \nDividends are an important factor when deciding whether to exercise options early. Whoever owns the stock on \nthe ex-dividend date receives the dividend, so call option holders may exercise the option early in order to \ncapture the dividend. \n \n \n \nHow To Read Option Quotes \n \nAll online brokers will have all options quotes you\u2019ll need to trade. Most will provide free real-time quotes, but \nsome may charge a small fee for real-time prices. \n \nIf you haven\u2019t started trading yet and are looking for free option quotes then Yahoo, CBOE and Nasdaq all \nprovide 20-minute delayed prices. \n \nIf you want to learn more about free quotes you can do so here. You will also find details of how to read options \nquotes provided by Interactive Brokers which is who I use for my trading. \n \nIn terms of reading option quotes generally, there are a few things to be aware of: \n \n\uf0b7 \nOpen interest and volume \n\uf0b7 \nThe Bid-Ask Spread \n\uf0b7 \nImplied Volatility \n\uf0b7 \nExpiration Dates \n \nOPEN INTEREST AND VOLUME \n \nVolume and Open Interest are related but also decidedly different. Volume is the number of contracts traded \nduring the day\u2019s session and that balance is wiped clean every day. \n \nWhether a trader is opening (buy to open or sell to open) or closing (buy to close or sell to close), it counts \ntowards that day\u2019s option volume for that particular expiry and strike price. \n \nOpen interest on the other hand is a tally of the total number of option contracts open and active at each strike. \nThis represents all trades that have not been closed or exercised. The number is only updated at the end of the \ntrading day once all trades have been tallied. \n \nAn interesting quirk is that volume can actually be higher in any given day than open interest. \n \nFor example, consider this case: \n \nDay 1: Trader A buys 5 contracts to open. We have daily volume of 5 and have 5 open contracts. \n \nDay 2: Trade A sells his 5 contracts and Trader B buys 20 contracts to open. \n \nOn day 2, volume would be 25 and open interest would be 20. \n \nThe important thing to note is that traders should focus on options with high volume (liquidity) and open \ninterest. \n \nFor example, take this option table on IYT, the Transportation ETF. \n \nIt wouldn\u2019t be wise for a trader to open 20 contracts in the 199 calls. Firstly, because the bid-ask spread is quite \nwide and there is no volume. \n \nBut also because this would represent basically all of the open interest in this strike. In this case, the market \nmakers will take advantage of you if you need to close the position in a hurry. \n \nGood luck getting filled at the mid-point on those! \n \n \n \n \nTHE BID-ASK SPREAD \n \nBelow you will find a standard options table, this one being from Interactive Brokers showing AAPL options. \n \n \n \nFirst and foremost, we have the calls on the left and the puts on the right. Looking at the calls we have the bid \nprice and the ask price. \n \nHopefully you know what a bid-ask spread is, but for those that don\u2019t here\u2019s a quick explanation: \n \nThe bid price is the highest price the market will currently pay to buy the option. The ask price is the lowest price \nthe market will currently sell the option. \n \nUsually when trading options, you can receive a price close to the mid-point of the spread, but sometimes the \nmarket makers will make you pay a little extra or receive a little less. \n \nFor example, the July $195 call has a spread of $2.40 - $2.46. The mid-point would be $2.43 but we may not be \nable to get filled at this price. \n \nIf we were buying the call, we might have to pay $2.44 or $2.45 and if we were selling the call, we might only get \n$2.42 or $2.41. \n \nAAPL is a highly liquid stock, so our chances of getting filled near the mid-point is much higher than if we were \ntrading options on a less liquid stock. \n \nIMPLIED VOLATILITY \n \nImplied volatility is a very important metric for option traders. Implied volatility is the only unknown element in \nthe options pricing model, because we cannot know in advance how much a stock will move between now and \nexpiration. \n \nThis value is an estimate, but the key thing to remember is that, just like a stock, we want to buy low and sell \nhigh. \n \nWe want to be a net buyer of options when implied volatility is low (options are cheap) and be a net seller of \noptions when implied volatility is high (options are expensive). \n \nAnother important thing to learn about implied volatility is skew. We can see below that each individual option \nhas its own implied volatility and they are not all the same. \n \nFor example, the $165 puts have implied volatility of 21.4% while the $200 puts have implied volatility of 15.2%. \n \nThis is known as skew. Some people refer to is as an implied volatility smile. \n \n \n \n \nEXPIRATION DATES \n \nExpiration dates are fairly self-explanatory, so I won\u2019t go in to too much detail here. But basically, there are \nthree common cycles to which the stocks are assigned: \n \n\u2022 January, April, July and October \n\u2022 February, May, August and November \n\u2022 March, June, September and December \n \nStocks will generally always have options for the current month and the next month in addition to whichever \ncycle it falls in from above. \n \nIn recent years, there has been a proliferation of weekly options, and some popular instruments like SPY have \noptions expiring every few days. \n \n \n \nMargin Requirements For Options \n \nMargins are designed to protect the financial security of the market. If a trader sells an option contract, he has a \npotential obligation to the market because the buyer of the option may exercise their position. \n \nWHAT IS OPTION MARGIN? \n \nOption margin is cash or securities that must be posted with the broker to cover collateral requirements. \n \nMargin requirements are set by FINRA and the options exchanges, however some brokers may add to the \nminimum requirements set by the regulators. \n \nOptions strategies that involve naked options such as strangles and straddles require significant amounts of \nmargin. \n \nOther option strategies such as covered calls and covered puts require no margin as the stock is used as \ncollateral. Likewise, debit spreads do not require margin because the obligation of the short option is offset by \nthe long option. \n \nMost traders with small accounts will fall under Reg T margin requirements. Those with larger accounts may be \neligible for Portfolio margin which is much more favourable for option traders. \n \nPortfolio margin is a policy of offsetting or consolidating option positions in order to account for a portfolio\u2019s \noverall risk. This can result in substantially lower margin requirements if traders have uncorrelated positions. \n \nOption Assignment and Exercise \n \nIt\u2019s not sexy, but option assignment and exercising is something you should have a basic understanding of \nbefore trading options. \n \nRemember that with options transactions there are two parties involved, a buyer and a seller. \n \nThe term exercise is used when the owner of a call or put \u201cexercises\u201d his or her right to buy or sell the stock. \n \nThey buy shares if the option is a call and they sell shares if they held a put. \n \nThe term assignment is used when someone has a short position in a call or put and is called upon to fulfil their \nobligation by someone who is exercising their rights. \n \nUnlike exercising the option, assignment means they must sell if it is a call and they must buy it if it is a put. \n \nYou can read more about option assignment and exercise here. \n \nOption Volatility \n \nOption volatility is a key concept for option traders and even if you are a beginner, you should try to have at \nleast a basic understanding. \n \nOption volatility is reflected by the Greek symbol Vega which is defined as the amount that the price of an \noption changes compared to a 1% change in volatility. \n \nIn other words, an options Vega is a measure of the impact of changes in the underlying volatility on the option \nprice. \n \nAll else being equal (no movement in share price, interest rates and no passage of time), option prices will \nincrease if there is an increase in volatility and decrease if there is a decrease in volatility. \n \nTherefore, it stands to reason that buyers of options (those that are long either calls or puts), will benefit from \nincreased volatility and sellers will benefit from decreased volatility. \n \nThe same can be said for spreads, debit spreads (trades where you pay to place the trade) will benefit from \nincreased volatility while credit spreads (you receive money after placing the trade) will benefit from decreased \nvolatility. \n \nHere is a theoretical example to demonstrate the idea. Let's look at a stock priced at 50. Consider a 6-month call \noption with a strike price of 50: \n \nIf the implied volatility is 90, the option price is $12.50 \nIf the implied volatility is 50, the option price is $7.25 \nIf the implied volatility is 30, the option price is $4.50 \n \nThis shows you that, the higher the implied volatility, the higher the option price. \n \nWHY IS VOLATILITY IMPORTANT \n \nOne of the main reasons for needing to understand option volatility, is that it will allow you to evaluate whether \noptions are cheap or expensive by comparing Implied Volatility (IV) to Historical Volatility (HV). \n \nAs option traders, implied volatility is where we can gain an edge. As the only unknown piece of the option \npricing puzzle, if our estimate of volatility over the course of our trade is better than the market estimate, we \nwin. Simple as that. \n \nFor this reason, we want to be buying implied volatility when it is low in comparison to recent history, and \nselling implied volatility when it\u2019s high. Just like we would with a stock. \n \nBuy low, sell high. Or sell high, buy low. \n \nBelow is a graphical view of implied volatility and historical volatility on AAPL stock. Implied volatility is in gold \nand historical volatility is in blue. \n \n \n \nThere are a couple of important things to note here: \n \n\uf0b7 \nImplied volatility is generally always higher than historical volatility. This is important because it shows \nus that the market over estimates the amount of volatility in the stock. Think about it this way, if we sell \nvolatility when it is at 40%, and if it ends up being only 20% through the life of our trade, we win. \n \n\uf0b7 \nSecondly, focussing just on the yellow line (IV), notice that sometimes it is high (35%-40%) and \nsometimes it is low (20%-25%). We want to be buying volatility when it is in the 20%-25% range and \nselling volatility when it is in the 35%-40% range. \n \nVOLATILITY SKEW \n \nA stock has a general level of implied volatility as we saw above, but every single option in the options chain also \nhas its own implied volatility. \n \nThe volatility is not always the same for different options. This is known as volatility skew. \n \nFor example, puts generally trade with higher implied volatility than calls. This is because markets tend to fall \nfaster than they rise and option sellers want to be compensated for that risk. \n \nThere are two other types of skew to be aware of as well \u2013 vertical skew and horizontal skew \n \nVERTICAL SKEW \n \nVertical skew refers to differences in implied volatility within a particular option expiration. \n \nBelow we have a table showing the implied volatility for 1-month put options in AAPL stock. \n \n \nNotice that each strike price has its own level of implied volatility and that the level rises as we move further \nout-of-the-money. \n \nThe reason for this is the same as above, traders are willing to pay more for \u201ccrash protection\u201d. This skew is \nknown as vertical skew and is fairly common across most stocks and indexes. \n \nHORIZONTAL SKEW \n \nAnother type of skew occurs across expiry dates and is known as horizontal skew. \n \nGenerally speaking, the further out in time you go the higher the implied volatility. This is because with more \ntime, there is more of a chance something can go wrong in the markets. \n \nThis is a normal situation called Contango (more on that in a minute). \n \nAnother reason why horizontal skew can occur is because of earnings reports. \n \nLet\u2019s use DE as an example this time. \n \nIn the table below, you can see that the options that expire before the earnings announcement have lower \nvolatility than the options that expire after the earnings announcement. The is much more risk of a big move in \nthe stock due to the unknown financial results, hence the implied volatility is larger. \n \n \n \nHere\u2019s an even better example to demonstrate the point, using a highly volatility stock \u2013 Roku, Inc. \n \nThe options that expire before earnings are all around 63% implied volatility. The options that will be exposed to \nthe earnings result have a whopping 92% implied volatility! \n \n \n \nTaking a $140 strike, the front week put is trading for $7.65 and the back week put is $12.59, even though they \nare only one week apart. You can see that implied volatility has such a big impact on options prices and now \nyou\u2019ll know to keep an eye out for it. \n \nVIX TERM STRUCTURE \n \nVIX Term Structure is an important concept for option traders, but it\u2019s an advanced topic for new traders to \ngrasp, so I\u2019ll break it down into the key points. \n \n\uf0b7 \nWhat is VIX Term Structure \n\uf0b7 \nKey terms such as Contango and Backwardation \n\uf0b7 \nHow to use VIX Term Structure in your trading \n\uf0b7 \nExamples of how the Term Structure is impacted during volatility spikes \n \nWHAT IS VIX TERM STRUCTURE? \n \nVIX Term Structure is the term used by CBOE for a set of expected S&P500 Index volatilities based on S&P500 \noptions of different time to maturity. \n \nThe VIX Index refers to a Volatility Index created by the Chicago Board Options Exchance (CBOE) that represents \nthe market\u2019s expectations of price movements in the S&P 500 over the next 30 days. \n \nVIX is one number whereas the VIX Term Structure refers to a set of several numbers measuring expected \nvolatility for different option expiry periods. \n \nA great source for looking at the current and past VIX Term Structure is www.vixcentral.com \n \nI look at this site almost daily to see what the market\u2019s expectation of future volatility looks like. Below you can \nsee an example of the VIX Term Structure. I\u2019ll explain more about this later in the article. \n \n \n \nCONTANGO AND BACKWARDATION \n \nBefore diving into the Term Structure we need to understand these two key terms. \n \nContango and backwardation are key terms that come from the futures market. Contango refers to a situation \nwhere the price of a commodity is higher in the future compared to the current spot price. \n \nThe main reason for this is what\u2019s called the cost of carry. If you think about it; it makes perfect sense. \n \nLet\u2019s say I know that I need 100 barrels of oil in 3 months\u2019 time. I could buy the barrels today for $50, but then I \nhave to pay storage costs for 3 months until I need it (cost of carry). \n \nIn this example, I might be willing to pay $51 to take delivery in 3 months rather than today, so that I don\u2019t need \nto pay for storage. \n \nContango is the most common scenario for futures. \n \nThe opposite of Contango is Backwardation which occurs when the spot price is higher than the futures price. \n \nIn the commodities market, this situation might occur when there is a perceived shortage of a commodity and \ncompanies are willing to pay a premium to take delivery today in order to keep their production lines running. \n \nWhile the terms Contango and Backwardation originated in the commodity futures market, they also apply to \nfinancial instruments. \n \nLike commodities, there is a cost of carry with financial instruments. Rather than storage costs, the cost of carry \non financial instruments is the interest rate paid to purchase and hold the instrument. \n \nMost of the time financial futures, such as VIX Futures, are in Contango. However, when there is a market panic, \nthey can flip into Backwardation pretty quickly. \n \nUsing VIX as an example, during a panic the spot price of VIX shoots higher, but the future price of VIX may not \ngo up by as much. \n \nThis is because the market knows that panics usually die down within a few weeks and things return to normal. \n \nYou\u2019ll see two great examples of this at the bottom of this article. \n \nWHY IS THE VIX TERM STRUCTURE IMPORTANT? \n \nVIX Term Structure is important because it tells us a lot about the current state of the market. \n \nWhen the Term Structure is in Contango, markets are in a calm state and are behaving normally. \n \nWhen we shift to Backwardation, markets are in panic mode. \n \nSometimes panics can reverse quickly such as during Brexit, but other times the market can remain in \nBackwardation for an extended period such as during the financial crisis of 2008. \n \nYes, taking a contrarian view can be profitable when markets panic, but we also need to be aware that some of \nthe worst market declines in history have come AFTER the VIX Futures market moved into Backwardation. \n \nTRADING STRATEGY FOR WHEN VIX IS IN CONTANGO \n \nIn this article, I discuss a strategy for trading VXX. The key premise is to: \n \n1. Wait for the market to move from Backwardation to Contango (likely means the panic is over) \n2. Buy VXX puts far out in time, usually that means at least 4-5 months for me. This gives the trade plenty \nof time to work out. \n3. Takes profits systematically as the trade moves in your favor. \nVIX TERM STRUCTURE EXAMPLES \n \nWhen traders talk about a \u201cvolatility spike\u201d, it\u2019s important to realize that not all months on the Curve are \nimpacted equally. \n \nSpot VIX may have had a big rise, but future months likely were not impacted as much. \n \nAs mentioned earlier in the article, I want to use a couple of examples to illustrate this point and talk about why \nit\u2019s important when trading options. \n \nAUGUST 2017 \n \n2017 was a very quiet time in the markets and volatility was incredibly low for most of the year. The VIX got as \nlow as 8.84 on July 26th!! \n \nOn August 9th, 2017 VIX closed at 11.11, and the next day spiked 44% to 16.04. In percentage terms, this was \none of the biggest spikes in history. \n \nThe chart below shows the VIX Term Structure on August 9th (blue) and August 10th (black). \n \nNotice that on August 10th we flipped from Contango to Backwardation. \n \n \n \nAlso notice that the spike was the most pronounced in the front months of the curve. \n \nThis is VERY important to understand as option traders. \n \nAnyone who was short volatility in those front month (short-term) options, would have been hit pretty hard. \n \nThe move was much less pronounced going out 90 days and further. \n \nThis is a key reason why I tend to focus on longer term trades these days, they are much less impacted by \nvolatility spikes and P&L moves much slower allowing me more time to react. \n \nFEBRUARY 2018 \n \nHere\u2019s another example from February 2018, commonly referred to as the \u201cvolpocalype\u201d. \n \nOn February 5th, VIX spike an almighty 115.6% from 17.31 to 37.32. \n \nThe previous biggest spike (excluding the 1987 crash because VIX didn\u2019t exist then) was 64.20% in February \n2007. \n \nJust let that sink in for a minute. \n \nThe spike was nearly twice as big as the previous biggest spike. It literally wiped out traders by the thousands \nand even saw the collapse of a few volatility ETF\u2019s. \n \nBelow, you can see what happened to the VIX Term Structure on that day. \n \n \n \nSimilar to August 2017, not all months on the curve were impacted and most of the damage was concentrated in \nthe front 3-4 months. \n \n \n \nVOLATILITY PRODUCTS \n \nVolatility products and trading volatility as an asset class has exploded in recent years. Popular products for \ntrading volatility include: \n \n\uf0b7 \nVIX options \n\uf0b7 \nVIX futures \n\uf0b7 \nVXX \n\uf0b7 \nUVXY \n\uf0b7 \nSVXY \n\uf0b7 \nVXST \n\uf0b7 \nTVIX \n\uf0b7 \nZIV \n\uf0b7 \nVXZ \n\uf0b7 \nVIXY \n \nThese volatility products should ABSOLUTELY NOT be traded by beginners. They are complex instruments and \nuntil you understand them, it is best to avoid them. \n \nYou can read this article if you want to understand how SVXY works. Most of the others will be similar, I won\u2019t \ngo into detail here because the products are not appropriate for beginners. \n \nSVXY famously dropped around 95% in one day during the \u201cvolpocalypse\u201d so that\u2019s one thing to keep in mind. \nXIV was another product that actually went bust on that same day, so the risks are definitely there. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOption Greeks \n \nOption Greeks are risk assessment metrics commonly employed in the Options Market to analyze different types \nof risk related to such securities. They are known as \u2018The Greeks\u2019 since each of the metrics is named after a \nparticular Greek word. There are five main Greeks and in this article, we will help you in understanding which \nkind of risk each of them measure. \n \nDelta (\u0394) \n \nDelta tracks the degree in which an option price changes in relation to the price of its underlying asset. The \ncalculation of Delta results in a range of 0 to 1 or -1 to 0 depending on the type of option (put or call) and it \nindicates the expected variation in the price of the option if the price of the underlying asset changes by 1%. For \nexample, a Delta of 0.3 indicates that if the price of the underlying asset increases by 1%, the price of the option \nwill increase by 0.3%. \n \nRELATED ARTICLES \nOIH Sold Puts With Delta Hedging \nEWZ Short Straddle With Delta Hedging Pays Off Nicely \nWhy Delta Dollars Will Change Your Option Trading Forever \nUnderstanding Option Delta \nHow to Hedge Option Delta With Futures \nA Quick and Easy Way to Cut Your Exposure in Falling Markets \nGamma (\u0393) \n \nGamma can be understood as a Delta-related calculation, as it measures the degree in which the Delta of a \nparticular option will change if the price of the underlying asset varies by 1%. It is, therefore, an estimation of \nhow sensitive the Delta of the option is. If Gamma is high, it means that the Delta of the option is highly volatile \nand therefore it can\u2019t be relied on as a sound indicator of its potential behavior. \n \nRELATED ARTICLES \nGamma Risk Explained \nOption Gamma Explained \nWhat Happens To Iron Condors When The Market Tanks \nVega (v) \n \nVega measures the response of an option\u2019s price to a change in the implied volatility of its underlying security. \nThe implied volatility is understood as the estimated potential variation of the price of a security. In this context, \nVega indicates the potential variation in the option\u2019s price if the implied volatility varies by 1%. For example, a \nVega of 0.7 is saying that if the implied volatility of the underlying asset changes by 1% the price of the option \nwill vary by 0.7%. Therefore, a security that is becoming highly volatile will increase the premium paid on the \noption. \n \nRELATED ARTICLES \nMake Vega Your Friend \nLong Strangle Option Strategy \nWhy Calendar Spreads Are An Oxymoron \nHow To Trade Volatility Using The VIX Index \nUnderstanding Implied Volatility \nDo Buyers of Options Benefit From High Volatility \nVolatility Trader Makes Gigantic Bet for December \nHow To Trade Volatility - Chuck Norris Style! \nTheta (\u0398) \n \nTheta measures the change in the price of an option as time passes and the expiration date approaches. Theta is \ncommonly expressed in absolute values and an option could have a negative or positive Theta. A negative Theta \nof say -0.30 indicates that each day that passes the option\u2019s price will decrease by $0.30. \n \nRELATED ARTICLES \nDo Options Lose Value Over The Weekend? \nThe Ultimate Guide To The Bear Call Spread \nPoor Man's Covered Call \nRho (\u03c1) \nRho measures the price sensitivity of the option in relation to a change in interest rates. The higher the Rho the \nmore sensitive it is to potential fluctuations in interest rates. A positive Rho means that the option will behave in \nthe same direction as the interest rate. If rates increase the option\u2019s price will increase, while a negative Rho \nindicates that the option\u2019s price will behave in the opposite direction of interest rates. A Rho of 0.04 means that \na 1% increase in interest rates will add $0.04 to the price of the option. \nPayoff Diagrams \n \nPayoff diagrams are something you will become intimately familiar with as you progress on your option trading \njourney. \n \nA payoff or break-even diagram shows the potential profit or loss on the strategy at different \nstock prices at expiry. Payoff diagrams can be drawn for any option or combination of options in \nthe one class. \n \nLet\u2019s take a simple example of a call option. There will be a different payoff diagram for the buyer and the seller. \n \nCALL OPTION BUYER \n \nAssume ABC Corporation is trading at $105 and a $100 call option is trading for $7. \n \nLooking at the below payoff diagram, we can see that the maximum loss on the trade is $700 which occurs at \n$100 and below. \n \nThe breakeven price on the trade is $107 which is equal to the strike price plus the price of the call. \n \nThe potential profits are unlimited. \n \n \n \nCALL OPTION SELLER \n \nCompare that with the seller of the call option. \n \nThe maximum loss for the call option seller is theoretically unlimited. \n \nThe maximum gain is $700 which is the premium the seller would receive. The breakeven price is also $107. \n \n \n \nPUT OPTION BUYER \n \nLet\u2019s now look at the payoff diagrams for put options. \n \nUsing our theoretical ABC options again, let\u2019s assume a $110 put is trading for $8 with ABC trading at $105. \n \nThe buyer of the put option pays $800 and this is the maximum they can lose on the trade. This occurs if ABC \nfinished at $110 or above. \n \nThe maximum gain is unlimited until the stock hits $0, in which case the put would be worth $11,000, so the \nprofit would be $11,000 less the $800 premium paid, so $10,200. \n \nThe breakeven price on the trade is $102 which is equal to the strike price of $110 less the $8 premium paid. \n \n \n \nPUT OPTION SELLER \n \nThe maximum gain for the put option seller is limited to the amount of premium received which is $800. \n \nThe maximum loss is unlimited up until the point the stock reaches $0, in which case the loss would be $10,200. \n \nThe breakeven price is $102. \n \n \nThese four pay-off diagrams are the basis for more advanced option strategies. By combining these positions, \nmore elaborate and complex strategies can be created, but it\u2019s important to have a solid understanding of these \nfour diagrams before moving on to more complex strategies. \n \nRisks When Trading Options \n \nOptions are not suitable for all investors. In light of the risks associated with trading options, \nyou should use them only if you are confident that you understand them and the risks. Before \nyou invest, you should carefully assess your experience, investment objectives, financial \nresources and all other relevant considerations, and of course consult your financial advisor. \n \nLet\u2019s take a quick look at some of the key risks when trading options: \n \nMARKET RISKS \n \nThe market value of options is affected by a range of factors. They may fall in price or become worthless on or \nbefore expiry. Changes in the price of the underlying may result in changes to the price of an option, but the \nchange can sometimes be in a different direction or of a different magnitude to the change in the price of the \nunderlying. \n \nLIQUIDITY RISK \n \nMarket Makers play an important role in the liquidity of the options market. However, their obligations to \nprovide quotes are not unqualified and your ability to trade out of a strategy may depend on you being able to \nobtain a quote from a Market Maker. When markets become volatile, bid-ask spreads can widen and it can be \ndifficult to close positions. \n \nOPTIONS ARE A WASTING ASSET \n \nOptions have an expiry date and therefore a limited life. An option\u2019s time value erodes over its life and this \naccelerates as an option nears expiry. Buyers of options have limited time to for their view to be fulfilled. \n \nLEVERAGE \n \nThe initial outlay of capital may be small relative to the total contract value with the result that options \ntransactions are \u2018leveraged\u2019 or \u2018geared\u2019. A relatively small market movement may have a proportionately larger \nimpact on the value of the option. This can work against you as well as for you. The use of leverage can lead to \nlarge losses as well as large gains. \n \nOPTION SELLERS FACE POTENTIALLY UNLIMITED LOSSES \n \nWriting (selling) options can involve considerably greater risks than buying options. The premium received by \nthe writer (seller) is fixed and limited, however the writer may incur losses greater than that amount. The writer \nwho does not own the underlying shares or does not have offsetting positions potentially faces unlimited losses. \n \nMARGIN CALLS \n \nA trader\u2019s liability in relation to a sold option contract is not limited to the amount of margin paid. If the market \nmoves against the position or margins are increased, the trader may be called upon to pay substantial additional \nfunds on short notice to maintain the position. \n \nIf they fail to comply with a broker request for additional funds within the time prescribed, the broker may close \nout the position and the trader will be liable for any loss that might result. \n \n \nThe Best Options Brokers \n \nThere are dozens of Options Brokers to choose from. But which option broker is most suitable for you? We will \nreview three top rated brokers in this chapter to help you decide the one that best meets your needs. The three \nbrokers that we will discuss include Interactive Brokers, Thinkorswim and Tastyworks. \n \nINTERACTIVE BROKERS REVIEW \n \nInteractive brokers is a world renown broker that was founded in 1977. They use a variable commission \nstructure that is quite a bit different than many other Options brokers. Based on their fee schedule, a client\u2019s \ncommission rate is calculated based on their trade size and value of each option. \n \nAs an example of this, the commission to buy a single call or put option priced between $.05 to $.10 would be \n$0.50 per contract with a minimum $1.00 fee. The same minimum would apply for options priced below $.05 \nand those priced above $.10, however the per contract pricing for options priced over $0.10 would be $0.70, \nwhile the per contract fee would $0.25 for those under $0.05.  \n \nThis variable commission schedule can be quite attractive for those that are trading multiple contracts and \nfrequently utilizing far out of the money options. One notable feature of IB\u2019s pricing structure is that is does not \ncharge a fee when options are exercised or assigned. \n \nOne of the biggest obstacles for many traders that wish to trade with Interactive brokers is their relatively high \n$10,000 minimum opening deposit. Recently, however, they have lowered that amount to $3,000 for individual \nclients who are under the age of 25. Additionally, if you are planning to trade using your IRA account, you will be \nable to do so with a minimum account of $5,000. \n \nFor the most part, Interactive Brokers has traditionally tried to cater to more experienced traders that have at \nleast a few years of experience under their belt. If you are an active options trader, that doesn\u2019t require too \nmuch hand holding, and have a reasonable sized stake to fund an account, then Interactive Brokers should be at \nthe top of your list of option brokers to consider. \n \nI use Interactive Brokers and have put together some videos on how to use their platform if you want to check \nthem out: \n \nhttp://bit.ly/IBplaylist \n \nTHINKORSWIM REVIEW \n \nThinkorswim is a free trading platform offered by TD Ameritrade. It is a robust, professional grade platform for \nOptions traders. It has a rich set of features that is second to none. Serious traders and investors will enjoy \nadvanced charting, real time data streaming, a wide range of technical indicators, and of course a full set of \noption trading tools. \n \nFor those that are interested in trying out the platform, they offer a paper trading program for users as a way to \ndemo the platform. They are an excellent choice for active traders who need to keep their transaction costs \ndown. Currently, TD Ameritrade does not charge commissions to trade stocks, ETFs or Options. The current \noption trading fees is based on a fixed $0.65 / contract basis. Additionally, there is no account minimum to open \nan account. \n \nHere are a two key advantages of using thinkorswim: \n \nAdvanced trading tools - If you like to use technical indicators, or advanced charting tools such as Fibonacci or \nRegression channels, you will find these types of visual tools in abundance on the platform. Additionally, as a \nthinkorswim user, you will have access to thousands of economic data points for both domestic and \ninternational markets. Systematic traders can create their very own trading algorithms using thinkscript. \n \nLow trading costs - Thinkorswim is a low cost leader in the options trading industry. They offer $0 per trade \npricing on all stock and options trades. You will only pay a small per contract fee for trading options. That fee \ncurrently is $0.65 / contract. \n \nWhile there are many reasons to trade with thinkorswim, one might wonder if there are any downsides. The \nmain drawback that users experience when trading with thinkorswim is the following: \n \nLearning the platform - There is a steep learning curve for beginning traders who want to start using the \nthinkorswim platform. With all the advanced tools and bells and whistles that come with the platform, it can \nsometimes overwhelm newer traders at times. \n \nHaving said that, there is a very helpful learning center dashboard, where those new to the platform, can watch \nvideos and review training manuals to help get up to speed with the platform.  \n \nTASTYWORKS REVIEW \n \nTastyworks is a fairly new broker within the industry. They are affiliated with Tastytrade, a very popular online \ntrading community, which was founded by Tom Sosnoff. He was a key figure in the development of the \nThinkorswim platform which he eventually sold to TD Ameritrade. \n \nRegarding the fee structure for option trades, Tastyworks is quite competitive. They offer a price of $ 1 per \ncontract on equity options which is charged on the open side only. Essentially that would equate to $0.50 per \ncontract, if you were comparing their fee to other completing brokers. In addition to this, multi leg option \ntraders will be glad to hear that they offer a commission cap of $10 per leg. \n \nThe opening account minimum at Tastyworks depends on the type of account that a client opens. For a Cash \naccount, there is no minimum deposit required for opening an account. On the other hand, if you would like to \nopen a margin account, then you will need to deposit $2,000 to open an account. \n \nOne of the biggest advantages of trading options through Tastyworks is their user friendly trading platform. The \nplatform is very intuitive and visually appealing. It has a rich set of features including a proprietary liquidity \nrating, and volatility rankings. You will also find a list of notable stocks to watch based on various pre-defined \nparameters. \n \nTheir advanced platform technologies extends to their mobile app as well. You can quickly and easily navigate \nthrough the mobile app without having to fumble around looking for what you need. Tastyworks is an excellent \nchoice for both novice and experienced option traders alike. The platform has a relatively short learning curve, \nand is well suited for active options traders. \n \nEach of the brokers on our list above are very reputable and most traders would do fine trading with either \nthree. However, generally speaking if you are new to the Options market, then you may find that Tastyworks \nsuits you a bit better. You may do well to start with them, and possibly move your way up to Thinkorswim or \nInteractive Brokers after gaining some experience. \n \n \n \n \nBasic Option Strategies \n \n \nOnce you learn option trading, a whole new world will open up. A world where you can profit in any market \ncondition. \n \nThe four trades that form the basis of all option strategies are \u2013 Long Call, Short Call, Long Put, Short Put. \n \nI would also class Covered Calls as a \u201cbasic\u201d option strategy as it is very easy for beginners to grasp and a logical \nplace to start for those that are familiar with stock ownership. \n \nLet take a look at the basic options strategies: \n \nLONG CALL \n \nThe long call strategy is the most basic strategy where traders will buy call options with the belief that the \nunderlying security will rise in price significantly before the expiration date. \n \nLong calls can produce outsized returns in percentage terms when compared with owning the stock because of \nthe inherent leverage within the option. \n \nHowever, if the expected move does not eventuate before expiry, a 100% loss can occur. \n \nThe long call strategy has unlimited profit potential and the losses are limited to the amount of premium paid. \n \nThe breakeven price on the trade is equal to the strike price plus the premium paid. \n \n \n \nLONG PUT \n \nThe long put strategy is the opposite to a long call where traders are betting that the underlying stock will drop \nsignificantly before expiration. \n \nBuying a put can be a more convenient way to short a stock compared with short selling where the trader has to \nborrow the stock to sell it short. \n \nThe profit potential is unlimited up to the point of the stock going to $0. \n \nRisk are limited to the premium paid for the put. Compare that with short selling the stock where the losses are \npotentially unlimited. \n \nThe breakeven price is the strikes price minus the premium paid. \n \n \n \nSHORT CALL \n \nInstead of buying a call option, traders can sell them. This may be part of a Covered Call strategy which we\u2019ll \ncover in a minute, but if the short call is not covered by either stock or a long call, then it is a naked position. \n \nSelling a naked call can be very risky. The gains are limited to the premium received but the losses are \npotentially unlimited if the stock continues to rise. \n \nFor this reason, some brokers will not allow new traders to sell naked calls. \n \nThe breakeven price on the trade is the strike price plus the premium received. \n \n \n \nSHORT PUT \n \nA short put strategy involves selling a put option which, similar to a short call, can either be covered or naked. \n \nA covered put strategy is when a trader sells a put option and also holds a short position in the underlying \nshares. This is not an overly common strategy because of the costs involved with holding the short stock \nposition. \n \nNaked puts and cash secured puts are much more common. \n \nSelling a put option is a great way to take ownership of a stock at a price lower than it is trading on that day. \n \nIf the stock drops and the trader is assigned the shares, they can then hold the shares, collect the dividend and \nsell call options. This is a very powerful strategy that I call The Wheel. \n \nThe maximum profit on a short put is limited to the premium received and the potential losses are unlimited up \nto the point where the stock reaches $0. \n \n \n \nCOVERED CALL \n \nI could talk for hours on Covered Calls. In fact, I\u2019ve done just that in my free Covered Call Course which you may \nwant to check out. \n \nThe covered call is a strategy where calls are sold against a holding of the underlying security. For doing this, the \ninvestor is paid a premium which is theirs to keep. \n \nThey get to hold their shares and enjoy all the benefits including dividends and voting rights, unless the call \noption is exercised, and the shares are called away. \n \nCovered calls are an income strategy where investors are aiming to increase the yield from holding stock. \nDepending on the investors outlook they may place the call at-the-money to generate the most amount of \nincome, or they may place the call out-of-the-money in order to maintain some capital appreciation potential. \n \nOption Definitions \n \nAmerican Style Option - An option contract that may be exercised at any time between the date of entry and the \nexpiry.
