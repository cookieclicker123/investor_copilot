{"text": "Introduction\nThe easiest way to learn options is with pictures so that you can begin to piece\ntogether strategies step-by-step. However, first we need to understand the four\nbasic strategies. From that point, logic kicks in, and our learning can progress\nexponentially.\nA risk profile chart shows us our profit/loss position for each trade. It differs from\na standard price/time chart that we\u2019re used to seeing to monitor stock prices. \nThere are four easy steps to creating a risk profile chart: \nStep 1: Y axis for profit/loss position\nProfit +\nLoss -\n+25\n0\n\u201325\n1\nThe Four Basic Options\nStrategies\n2\nThe Bible of Options Strategies\nStep 2: X axis for underlying asset price range\nStep 3: Breakeven line\nStep 4: Risk Profile line\nBreakeven\nProfit +\n+25\n\u201325\nStock Purchase Price\nLoss -\n0\n0\nAsset Price ($)\n50\n25\n0\nProfit +\nLoss -\nBreakeven\n+25\n0\n-25\n0\nAsset Price ($)\n50\n25\nProfit +\nLoss -\n+25\n0\n\u201325\n50\n25\n0\nAsset Price ($)\nThis chart shows our risk profile for a long stock position. As the asset price rises\nabove our purchase price (along the x-axis), we move into profit. Our risk is capped\nto what we paid, as is our breakeven point, and our potential reward is uncapped. \nThe reverse position is when we short a stock, in which case the opposite occurs.\nHere, as the stock price rises above our short price, our short position shows a loss,\nwhich can be unlimited as the stock continues to rise. Our risk is uncapped as the\nstock rises, and our potential reward is the price we shorted at, as is our breakeven\npoint. \nNow that we know how to interpret a risk profile chart, we can proceed with\nanalyzing each strategy.\nThe four basic strategies that underpin your entire options trading knowledge are:\n\u25a0\nLong Call\n\u25a0\nShort Call\n\u25a0\nLong Put\n\u25a0\nShort Put\nWe should already know that owning an option exposes us to time decay, so typi-\ncally we like to own options with expiration dates that are reasonably far away to\ngive us a chance of our option increasing in value. \nWith options, we have the \u201cRule of the Opposites,\u201d where if one thing isn\u2019t true,\nthen the opposite must be true. Therefore, if time decay hurts us when we buy\noptions, it must help us when we sell options. Because time value decreases (or time\ndecay increases) exponentially during the last month to expiration, we typically\ndon\u2019t like to own options into that last month, but we do like to sell options with one\nmonth left to expiration. \nWith these four strategies, we would buy calls and puts with at least three\nmonths (or more) left to expiration, thereby looking for the options to increase in\nvalue during that time. \nWe would short calls and puts with a month or less to expiration, thereby look-\ning for short-term income as the option hopefully expires worthless.\nProfit +\nLoss -\n0\n0\nStock Short Price\nAsset Price ($)\nThe Four Basic Options Strategies\n3\n4\nThe Bible of Options Strategies\nBuying a Call \n\u25a0\nBelief that stock will rise (bullish outlook) \n\u25a0\nRisk limited to premium paid \n\u25a0\nUnlimited maximum reward \nBuying a Put \n\u25a0\nBelief that stock will fall (bearish outlook)\n\u25a0\nRisk limited to premium paid \n\u25a0\nUnlimited maximum reward up to the strike\nprice less the premium paid \nWriting a Put \n\u25a0\nBelief that stock will rise (bullish outlook) \n\u25a0\nRisk \u201cunlimited\u201d to a maximum equating to\nthe strike price less the premium received\n\u25a0\nMaximum reward limited to the premium\nreceived \n\u25a0\nCan be combined with another position to\nlimit the risk\nWriting a Call \n\u25a0\nBelief that stock will fall (bearish outlook) \n\u25a0\nMaximum reward limited to premium\nreceived \n\u25a0\nRisk potentially unlimited (as stock price\nrises)\n\u25a0\nCan be combined with another position to\nlimit the risk\nThe Four Basic Options Risk Profiles\nImagine that the dotted lines are mirrors and see how each strategy is the opposite\nof the one on the other side of the mirror. \n1.1 Long Call\nProficiency\nDirection\nVolatility\nAsset Legs\nMax Risk\nMax Reward\nStrategy Type\nN/A\nNovice\nBullish\nLong Call\nCapped\nUncapped\nCapital Gain\n1.1.1 Description\nBuying a call is the most basic of all option strategies. For many people, it constitutes\ntheir first options trade after gaining experience buying and selling stocks. \nCalls are easy to understand. A call is an option to buy, so it stands to reason that\nwhen you buy a call, you\u2019re hoping that the underlying share price will rise. \nITM\nIn the Money\nstock \u0001 call strike price\nATM\nAt the Money\nstock \u0002 call strike price\nOTM\nOut of the Money\nstock \u0003 call strike price\nBuy call\nSteps to Trading a Long Call\n1.\nBuy the call option.\n\u25a0\nRemember that for option contracts in the U.S., one contract is for 100\nshares. So when you see a price of $1.00 for a call, you will have to pay\n$100 for one contract. \n\u25a0\nFor S&P Futures options, one contract is exercisable into one futures con-\ntract. If the option price is $1.00, you will pay $250 for one futures contract\nupon exercise. \nSteps In\n\u25a0\nTry to ensure that the trend is upward and identify a clear area of support. \nSteps Out\n\u25a0\nManage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan. \n\u25a0\nSell your long options before the final month before expiration if you want\nto avoid the effects of time decay.\n\u25a0\nIf the stock falls below your stop loss, then exit by selling the calls.\n!\nThe Four Basic Options Strategies\n5\n6\nThe Bible of Options Strategies\n1.1.2 Context\nOutlook\n\u25a0\nWith a Long Call, your outlook is bullish. You expect a rise in the underlying\nasset price. \nRationale\n\u25a0\nTo make a better return than if you had simply bought the stock itself. Do\nensure that you give yourself enough time to be right; this means you should\ngo at least six months out, if not one- or two-year LEAPs. If you think these are\nexpensive, then simply divide the price by the number of months left to expi-\nration and then compare that to shorter-term option prices. You will see that\nLEAPs and longer-term options are far better value on a per month basis, and\nthey give you more time to be right, thus improving your chances of success.\nAnother method is to buy only shorter-term deep ITM options. \nNet Position\n\u25a0\nThis is a net debit transaction because you pay for the call option. \n\u25a0\nYour maximum risk is capped to the price you pay for the call. \n\u25a0\nYour maximum reward is uncapped.\nEffect of Time Decay\n\u25a0\nTime decay works against your bought option, so give yourself plenty of time\nto be right. \n\u25a0\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the false economy that shorter options are cheaper.\nCompare a one-month option to a 12-month option and divide the longer\noption price by 12. You will see that you are paying far less per month for the\n12-month option. \nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\n\u25a0\nAt least three months, preferably longer, depending on the particular circum-\nstances. \nSelecting the Stock\n\u25a0\nChoose from stocks with adequate liquidity, preferably over 500,000 Average\nDaily Volume (ADV). \n\u25a0\nTry to ensure that the trend is upward and identify a clear area of support. \nSelecting the Option\n\u25a0\nChoose options with adequate liquidity; open interest should be at least 100,\npreferably 500. \n\u25a0\nStrike\u2014Look for either the ATM or ITM (lower) strike below the current stock. \n\u25a0\nExpiration\u2014Give yourself enough time to be right; remember that time decay\naccelerates exponentially in the last month before expiration, so give yourself a\nminimum of three months to be right, knowing you\u2019ll never hold into the last\nmonth. That gives you at least two months before you\u2019ll need to sell. Longer\nwould be better, though. \n1.1.3 Risk Profile\n\u25a0\nMaximum Risk\n[Call premium]\n\u25a0\nMaximum Reward\n[Uncapped] \n\u25a0\nBreakeven\n[Call strike \u0004 call premium] \n1.1.4 Greeks\nRisk Profile\nTheta\nDelta\nGamma\nRho\nVega\nKey:\nExpiration\nToday \u2013 6 months\nTime(t) \u2013 1 month\nThe Four Basic Options Strategies\n7\nRisk Profile\nAs the stock price\nrises, the long call\nmoves into profit\nmore and more\nquickly, particularly\nwhen the stock price\nis greater than the\nstrike price.\nRho\nRho is positive, illus-\ntrating that higher\ninterest rates would\nincrease the value\nof the calls and\ntherefore help the\nposition.\nVega\nVega is positive, illus-\ntrating that volatility\nis helpful to the posi-\ntion because higher\nvolatility translates\ninto higher option\nvalues.\nTheta\nTheta is negative,\nillustrating that time\ndecay hurts the long\ncall position.\nDelta\nDelta (speed) is posi-\ntive and increases at\nits fastest rate around\nthe strike price, until\nit reaches 1.

A Short Call exposes us to\nuncapped risk if the stock rises meteorically, and brokers will only allow experi-\nenced options traders to trade the strategy in the first place. \nA call is an option to buy, so it stands to reason that when you buy a call, you\u2019re\nhoping that the underlying share price will rise. If you\u2019re selling or shorting a call,\nit\u2019s therefore logical that you\u2019d want the stock to do the opposite\u2014fall. \nSell call\nSteps to Trading a Short Call\n1.\nSell the call option with a strike price higher than the current stock price. \n\u25a0\nRemember that for option contracts in the U.S., one contract is for 100\nshares. So when you see a price of $1.00 for a call, you will receive $100 for\none contract. \nSteps In\n\u25a0\nTry to ensure that the trend is downward or rangebound and identify a\nclear area of resistance. \nSteps Out\n\u25a0\nManage your position according to the rules defined in your Trading Plan. \n\u25a0\nHopefully the stock will decline or remain static, allowing your sold option\nto expire worthless so you can keep the entire premium. \n\u25a0\nIf the stock rises above your stop loss, then exit the position by buying back\nthe calls. \n\u25a0\nTime decay will be eroding the value of your call every day, so all other\nthings being equal, the call you sold will be declining in value every day,\nallowing you to buy it back for less than you bought it for, unless the\nunderlying stock has risen of course. \nThe Four Basic Options Strategies\n9\n10\nThe Bible of Options Strategies\n1.2.2 Context\nOutlook\n\u25a0\nBearish\u2014You are expecting a fall in the stock price; you are certainly not\nexpecting a rise in the stock.\nRationale\n\u25a0\nTo pick up short-term premium income as the stock develops price weakness. \nNet Position\n\u25a0\nThis is a net credit transaction because you are receiving a premium for the\ncall. \n\u25a0\nYour maximum risk is uncapped. \n\u25a0\nYour maximum reward is capped to the price you receive for the call.\nEffect of Time Decay\n\u25a0\nTime decay is helpful to your naked sold option, so take advantage of the max-\nimum time erosion. Maximum time decay (or theta decay) occurs in the last\nmonth before the option\u2019s expiration, so it makes sense to sell one-month or\nless options only. \n\u25a0\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the false economy that selling longer options would be\nmore lucrative. Compare a one-month option to a 12-month option and multi-\nply the shorter option price by 12. You will see that you are receiving far more\nper month for the one-month option. Also remember that you want the person\non the long side of this trade to have as short a time as possible to be right. \n\u25a0\nGive yourself as little time as possible to be wrong because your maximum\nrisk is uncapped. \nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\n\u25a0\nOne month or less.\nSelecting the Stock\n\u25a0\nChoose from stocks with adequate liquidity, preferably over 500,000 Average\nDaily Volume (ADV). \n\u25a0\nTry to ensure that the trend is downward and identify a clear area of\nresistance.\nSelecting the Option\n\u25a0\nChoose options with adequate liquidity; open interest should be at least 100,\npreferably 500. \n\u25a0\nStrike\u2014Look for OTM strikes above the current stock price.\n\u25a0\nExpiration\u2014Give yourself as little time to be wrong. Remember that your\nshort position exposes you to uncapped risk, and that time decay accelerates\nexponentially (in your favor when you\u2019re short) in the last month before expi-\nration, so only short the option with a maximum of one month to expiration,\npreferably less.\n1.2.3 Risk Profile\n\u25a0\nMaximum Risk\n[Uncapped]\n\u25a0\nMaximum Reward\n[Call premium] \n\u25a0\nBreakeven\n[Call strike \u0004 call premium]\n1.2.4 Greeks\nRisk Profile\nTheta\nDelta\nGamma\nRho\nVega\nKey:\nExpiration\nToday \u2013 6 months\nTime(t) \u2013 1 month\nThe Four Basic Options Strategies\n11\nRisk Profile\nAs the stock price\nrises, the short call\nloses money more\nand more quickly,\nparticularly when the\nstock price is greater\nthan the strike price.\nRho\nRho is negative, illus-\ntrating that higher\ninterest rates would\nharm the Short Call\nposition. \nVega\nVega is negative, illus-\ntrating that volatility\nis unhelpful to the\nposition because\nhigher volatility trans-\nlates into higher\noption values.

You will see that you are receiving far more\nper month for the one-month option. \nAppropriate Time Period to Trade\n\u25a0\nOne month or less.\nSelecting the Stock\n\u25a0\nChoose from stocks with adequate liquidity, preferably over 500,000 Average\nDaily Volume (ADV). \n\u25a0\nTry to ensure that the trend is upward and identify a clear area of support. \nSelecting the Option\n\u25a0\nChoose options with adequate liquidity; open interest should be at least 100,\npreferably 500.\n\u25a0\nStrike\u2014Look for OTM (lower strike) options, below the current stock price.\n\u25a0\nExpiration\u2014Give yourself as little time to be wrong; remember that your short\nposition exposes you to uncapped risk (until the stock falls to zero) and that\ntime decay accelerates exponentially (in your favor when you\u2019re short) in the\nlast month before expiration, so only short the option with a maximum of one\nmonth to expiration, preferably less. \n1.4.3 Risk Profile\n\u25a0\nMaximum Risk\n[Put strike \u0005 put premium]\n\u25a0\nMaximum Reward\n[Put premium] \n\u25a0\nBreakeven\n[Put strike \u0005 put premium]\n1.4.4 Greeks\n1.4.5 Advantages and Disadvantages\nAdvantages\n\u25a0\nIf done correctly, you can use Naked Puts to gain a regular income from rising\nor rangebound stocks. \n\u25a0\nThe Naked Put is an alternative way of buying a stock at a cheaper price than\nin the current market. This is because if you\u2019re exercised, you\u2019re obligated to\nbuy stock at the low strike price, having already received a premium for\nselling the puts in the first place. \nDisadvantages\n\u25a0\nNaked Puts expose you to uncapped risk (as the stock falls to zero) if the stock falls.\n\u25a0\nNot a strategy for the inexperienced. You must only use this strategy on stocks\nyou\u2019d love to own at the put strike price you\u2019re selling at.
