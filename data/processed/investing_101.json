Is Investing in Stocks Really Difficult? \nInvesting is a lot like driving a car and going on a journey. A car is complex to build but \neasy to drive. However, every beginner goes through the pains of learning how to drive. \nOnce you have learned, you focus on the road, the traffic ahead. And more importantly on \nwhere you want to go and the route you need to take. \nToday, you don\u2018t even worry about the route as long as you have the GPS and know how to \nuse it. \nIn the series, Stock Investing Made Simple you will learn the equivalent of how to drive and \nhow to use the GPS \u2013 moneyworks4me.com, to reach your financial goal. \nSoon you will love the journey as much as reaching your destination. \nStock investment is governed by certain fundamental principles, you cannot change \nthem but you can use them to your advantage. \nWhen you learn how to drive a car you first learn the basics of how the car works, not \nengineering but how it functions. \nYou learn how to start the car, use the different pedals, the steering, change gears, switch \non lights and wipers; and very importantly, read the dashboard to make the car work the way \nit is designed to. \nThe car works according to certain fundamental principles and the driver cannot change that. \nFor example, you press the accelerator it will run faster, provide you not also pressing the \nclutch pedal or have forgotten to release the hand-brakes. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nIn which case pressing the accelerator and giving more fuel will only rev the engine, make a \nlot of noise and spoil your car. \nAnd losing your cool and cursing the car will do the same to your body and also hurt your \npassengers\u2018 peace of mind. A good driver knows these fundamentals. \nWhat is the right price to buy a stock? \n \nTo answer this you need to know the most important principle of Stock investing: The \nfair value of a stock depends on its ability to generate profits consistently, and that the \nmarket prices in the long term always depend on this. \nTherefore it is sensible to anchor the buying price to a stock\u2018s fair value. You may buy at a \ndiscount to its fair price to be on the safer side or close to the fair price. \nHowever, this is not a simple straight-line affair because of what happens every day in the \nstock market. \nWhy do stock prices change every day? \n \nShort term stock prices are driven by demand and supply. Daily and short term price \nmovement depends on the number of buyers versus a number of sellers. \nMany, if not the most of them are traders, speculators and very few are real investors. \nTheir reasons to buy or sell are completely different from those of investors. However, they \nare in large numbers and trade-in volumes substantially larger than investors. \nAll of them are strongly influenced by short term events and hence prices fluctuate a lot. \nA long term investor need not even try to make sense of these fluctuations. However, they \nneed to know the fair price or value of the stock to take investment decisions. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nWhy learn how to invest in stocks when we have options like \nMutual funds? \n \nThere are about 350 equity mutual funds while there are about 200 good quality stocks \nworth investing in. So it\u2018s not easy to know which mutual fund to buy. \nCurrently, decisions are taken on the basis of past returns. But that is grossly inadequate. \nStocks are the underlying assets in equity mutual funds. \nA fund manager decides which stocks to buy, how much and at what price. \nKnowing the basics of stock investing helps you better understand what the equity mutual \nfund is invested in and why it makes sense to buy or not buy it. \nAnd finally, you pay for these services and quite a lot, so you need to know whether you are \ngetting your money\u2018s worth. \nYou cannot be ignorant and leave investing to your MF Distributor, Wealth Manager, \nRelationship Manager, your Insurance Advisor or your Broker. \nBecause simply put- \n\u2015In investing, ignorance is not bliss, Ye paise ka mamla hai.\u2016 \nBut isn\u2018t stock investing risky? \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nTill we learn to drive a vehicle we all find it very risky. When learning how to drive a vehicle, \nwe experience some tension and anxiety. \nBut we don\u2018t abandon learning how to drive because we understand it is a necessary skill \ntoday. \nDriving always carries some risk, but we have learned how to manage it and avoid \nunnecessary risks. \nYes, there are buses, trains, and flights, but our personal mobility needs are best served by \nknowing how to drive some vehicles. \nInvesting is something you will need to do for decades and knowing the basics of \ninvesting especially in stocks is a piece of necessary, life-enhancing knowledge and skill. \n \n2. What is essential for success in Stocks Investing? \nWhat would success in stock investing mean? \n \nWe want our savings, our surplus money to grow to meet our financial needs and goals of \nthe future. \nHow does your surplus money grow? Does it follow a formula? \nYes, actually it does; it\u2018s the Wealth Formula, \nWealth = Surplus (1+returns) ^years invested \nEssentially, when you put your surplus money to earn returns higher than inflation and let it \ncompound for a number of years, your savings grow into wealth. \nAs you can see there are 3 variables, Surplus (the saving you put to work), Returns (CAGR) \nthat you earn and No. of years you stay invested and earn these returns. \nWhat should you focus on to grow your money? \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n \nThe Sensible investor focuses on maximizing the 3rd variable of the Wealth Formula i.e. \nyears invested \u2013 allowing his money to compound as long as possible. \nTo do this he has the expectation of a sensible return i.e. substantially higher than inflation \nrates but not so high that it requires taking high risks. \nThese are the kind of risks that make him so uncomfortable that he wants to exit the market \nwhen it is volatile. Since he takes moderate risks he confidently invests a large portion of his \ntotal surplus in this manner. \nSo focusing on staying invested helps to grow money faster without running the high risk. \nWhat leads to exiting one\u2018s investments? \n \nThe main reason investors exit their equity investments is their discomfort in handling a fall \nin the portfolio when the market corrects. \nThe way to reduce the drop is ensuring asset allocation to debt and equity. \nFor example, a 50:50 split ensures that the investor\u2018s portfolio drops by roughly half the \namount the market corrects. \nSo even if the market corrects by 20%, the investor sees about a 10% drop in his portfolio \nsomething that makes us uncomfortable but not panics. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nSo you should not put your entire investable surplus in stocks but limit it to the extent \nrecommended by your risk profile. \nTypically this means a debt to equity as 60-40 for conservative, 50-50 for Moderate and 40-\n60 for Aggressive profiles. \nWhat can help an investor to stay invested in his portfolio? \n \nInvesting in strong companies will give you the confidence to stay invested even when the \nmarket corrects. Imagine your portfolio is 1 cr, a 20% drop would mean a paper loss of 20 \nlacs. \nA portfolio with a large amount of small and mid-cap stocks and some risky companies could \nfall by this much. \nWould you have the heart to hold onto such companies? Most would sell and get out and \nincur a real loss. \nHow long will it take to create wealth from investing? \n \nInvesting is not a get rich quick formula. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nAs you can see from the Wealth Building Formula if you wanted to get rich quick i.e. the \nperiod you stay invested is small, then to create wealth you need to earn very high returns; \nthe kind of returns that are offered in casinos and race tracks, provided you win. \nBut that seldom ever happens because the odds are always in favor of the house, the \nbookie, the casino. The same happens when you invest in stocks hoping to earn very high \nreturns. \nRemember investing is a marathon, not a 100-meter sprint. \nNow you need to choose between get-rich-quick and get- rich-definitely and sensible \nInvestors choose the latter. \nAfter all, having worked hard for their money it is not sensible to let our impatience prevent \nus from growing our savings into wealth. \nSo what is essential to investing in stocks and succeeding? \n \nIt\u2018s following these 2 Rules; \nRule No 1: Stay invested and let the power of compounding do its magic. \nRule No 2: Do things that help you follow Rule No 1; avoid the rest. \nThese include; \n1. Do not invest your entire surplus in stocks. Limit it to the asset \nallocation recommended by your risk profile. Think max 60%. \n2. Keep your returns expectations from stocks reasonable say twice the returns \nfrom an FD. \n3. Invest in strong companies only. \nRemember: Investing and compounding at higher than inflation rates substantially reduces \nthe money you need to set aside for your future goals. And all this without losing sleep. \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n3. How to invest in a stock successfully? \nHow to select the stocks for my portfolio? \n \nTo select the stocks and build a strong portfolio you need to know: \n1. Which are the right stocks to invest in? \n2. What is the right price to invest in? \n3. How much of each stock should you own? \nHere are the answers to these 3 questions: \n1. Invest in stocks of great businesses. \n2. Invest at attractively low prices-the right price where you can earn healthy inflation-\nbeating returns. \n3. Manage a diversified portfolio of around 20 such stocks. \nOnce you accept these as the principles that guide your stock-investing decisions, you will \nmake fewer mistakes and none of them will derail you. \nMore importantly, you will not get distracted and will invest your time very productively. \n \nBuilding a \u2017Wealth Creating Portfolio\u2018 \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nWhich is the right stock to invest in? \n \nBuying stock and investing in stock are very different things. Investing is buying a stock \nexpecting that it will grow in value for years and therefore holding them for a long time is \ninvesting. \nEvery other buying is speculating. Great businesses grow and become more valuable with \ntime because they have a robust, profitable and growing business. \nHolding them for long allows the power of compounding to work its magic and giving \nyou great returns. \n \nPower of Compounding \nThe future of mediocre and poor business is bleak and uncertain and so when you buy such \na stock you are actually hoping that there will be other buyers who will be willing to pay \nhigher prices for it. \nAsk yourself why would they buy it at higher prices? Are you banking on their ignorance or \nstupidity? Because if you then remember the guys who sold you that stock has already done \nso successfully! \nNever buy a mediocre or poor business no matter how cheap its price appears. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nAnd what about companies that are not great businesses but better \nthan mediocre? \nThese companies may see modest growth in value over time and to earn good risk-adjusted \nreturns you need to buy them only when they are available at a hefty discount. And \nwhenever required, sell to make room for the best. \nWhy wait for an attractively low price before buying a good stock? \n \nThe second rule, Buy at attractively low prices-the right price needs some explaining. \nImagine you knew the fair price of a stock. \nYou would then be able to assess if the current prices are attractive or not. \nBuying even great businesses at very high prices can result in poor returns; maybe even \nlower than a fixed deposit over the next 3-5 years. \nAnd suppose the markets were to correct in this period or there is a short term problem \nfaced by the company which usually leads to sharp corrections. \nYou would be facing a loss in your portfolio, shaking your confidence in an otherwise strong \ncompany. \nAlso, sooner or later, the market gives you many opportunities to buy such wonderful \nbusinesses at attractive prices. (The proof: Look at the 52-week Highs and Lows of any \nof the Sensex/Nifty 50 stocks.). \nAn attractively low price is the safety good investors demand even when buying a good \nstock! \nThis takes care of some if not most of the volatility that can happen in the stock or in the \nmarket. \nWaiting for the right price of good stocks requires patience and many times the courage of \nconviction to do differently than the market. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nWhy? Because in the short term the market behaves like a voting machine -prices \nmove depending on what people favor and may over-react to short term adverse events, \noffering the stocks that you would love to own at an attractively low price. \nHow many stocks of a particular company should you buy? \n \nThe answer \u2017Manage a diversified portfolio of about 20 great/good stocks\u2018 says it all, \nbut requires some explaining. \nFirstly it says that you need to build a diversified portfolio and not be over-exposed to a stock \nor a sector because that increases your risk. \nGrowing your money requires deploying your entire investible surplus to earn high risk-\nadjusted returns. \nFor this, you have to get things right overall and not just on a couple of stocks. \nA diversified portfolio reduces risk and enables you to handle the downside that can happen \nin a few stocks or a sector. \nThe latter is very critical to success in investing, at times even more than having great \nresearch. \nHaving more than 20 may lead to over-diversification in a direct stock portfolio i.e not help \nreduce risk any further but adversely impact returns. \nNow you know the 3 guiding rules that together form a sound framework for investing in \nstocks successfully. And it\u2018s quite simple. \nHowever, success happens only when you stick to it, follow it consistently. \nThe common thread binding great investors like Benjamin Graham and Warren \nBuffett is they followed a simple and sound framework of investing and stuck to it with \ndiscipline. \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n4. How do you identify the right stocks/companies to \ninvest in? \nAs we said earlier buying a stock expecting that it will grow in value for years and therefore \nholding them for a long time is investing, everything else is speculating. \nWhen you invest in a company-stock you have to think you are going to own it \nforever. This is the best way to ensure you invest in the best. \nWhat kind of companies will qualify as investment-worthy?  \n \nIf you are currently investing in stocks, what is the method you use to select stocks? Is it low \nPrice to earnings, PE ratio or low Price to Book Value or High Dividend yield? \nThese methods over-simplify investing, and hence, are inadequate. \nThey don\u2018t tell you about the earning capacity of a company\u2014 the key driver of its stock \nprice in the long term. They may lead you to take the wrong decision. \nThe fact is that, in the short run, market sentiments drive the stock prices up or down, no \nmatter whether it is wonderful or not. \nBut, in the long run, the price of any stock is driven by the company\u2018s ability to consistently \nearn profits. \nAnd, a company can earn profits consistently, only if it has a wonderful business\u2014the \nbusiness which has done well and will continue to grow in the future. \nWhat is the One characteristic common in all wonderful \nbusinesses? \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n \n \nGreat businesses have one essential characteristic and that is they have a \nSustainable Moat. \nIn olden days, a castle used to be protected by a moat\u2014a wide channel dug around a castle \nand filled with water. \nWider the moat, more difficult it was for enemies to enter and capture the castle. \nFor you, the castle is a company you want to invest in. And, the moat is A sustainable \ncompetitive edge that protects the company from the competition and tough economic \nconditions! \nDuring tough times, companies fight harder to win a customer, which usually leads to a fall in \nprices, and thus, margins. \nOnly a company with a wide, unbreachable moat\u2014 a competitive edge\u2014 can maintain and \ngrow its profits even during tough economic conditions. \nA good business is like a strong castle with a deep moat around it. I want \nsharks in the moat. I want it untouchable\u2016 - Warren Buffett \nWhat would qualify as a real competitive edge, a Moat? \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nMoat #1 Brand: \n \nIf you had to buy toothpaste, which name comes to your mind? Most of us would think \nof Colgate and many of us would buy it. Why? Because this is a name many in India have \ncome to trust over the years. \nIt is quite easy to make toothpaste, maybe even better than Colgate, but without the Colgate \nbrand name, you will sell very little in India. This is the power of the Brand \u2013 the first moat. \nA strong brand helps a business to command a large market share and higher prices and \nmakes it very difficult for competition to grow. \nMoat #2: Patents and Trade Secrets: \n \nWouldn\u2018t we love to own a company that was the only one who could manufacture a \nparticular product and had no direct competition? \nThat is exactly what happens if a company has a Patent or a Trade Secret \u2013 the second \nmoat. \nThe most common examples: Pharma companies with Patents and food and beverage \ncompanies with unique and usually patented recipes like Coca Cola and McDonald\u2018s \nfries (which are made from specially grown potatoes!). \nMoat #3: Ability to collect a Toll: \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n \nWe use expressways/highways for a hassle-free travel\u2014faster, safer & comfortable. And, \nwe have to pay a toll for using it but we still prefer it. \nWouldn\u2018t you love to own a business that makes money every time someone uses it, and \npeople have no other real option. \nSome companies have exclusive control over particular areas. That gives them the ability to \ncollect a Toll \u2013 the third moat. \nE.g. If you want to advertise a product in South India on a television network, you would \nhave no real option but to advertise on Sun TV, because of its very high viewership. \nGoogle Adwords is another example of a toll moat-you can\u2018t reach people searching for \nsomething on the net without using Google Adword because Google is the only real search \nused by people! \nMoat #4: Switching Costs: \n \nWe are all creatures of habit. We do not like to change, especially, if a change requires a \nlittle bit of effort. The fourth moat that a company can have is based on this and is \ncalled Switching costs. \nIt means a company has a product or service you are so used to, that changing or switching \nit is either very difficult or not worth it. E.g. Microsoft Windows and Office. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nWe are so used to it, that changing to say Linux is not worth it \u2013 even though it is free and \noffers certain advantages over Windows. \nIndian IT Companies get most of their business from repeat clientele because of this very \nmoat. \nMoat #5: Operational Efficiency: \n \nOne of the biggest factors on which companies compete is price \u2013 the fifth moat. A \ncompany that can price its products really low and still makes a profit makes it difficult for \nanyone to compete with it. \nE.g. D-Mart (Avenue Supermarts Ltd.), its strong retail network and a value retailing format \ncombined with its large scale of operations enable it to offer good discounts on products. \nAnd this requires a company to have the highest operational efficiency. \nSo, the five types of moats that a company can have, that can stand the test of time \nare Brand, Secret, Toll, Switching Costs and Operational Efficiency. \nThere is one more moat that new technology has created and that is Network Effects. \nFacebook, Whatsapp are examples of it. \nEssentially it means that the value derived by users increases as more and more users get \nonto it. \nSo if your friends are on Facebook or Whatsapp you have no option but to use that to stay in \ntouch. This then becomes a winner-takes-all game and is a monopoly. \nUsually, the basic service is offered free and hence everyone gets onto it and revenues are \nthen earned through targeted advertising. \nIs there a way to confirm if a company has a sustainable moat? \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n \nYes. If a company has a sustainable moat it should be able to deliver healthy profits \nconsistently. So look at its financial track record over 10 years. \nWhy 10 years? Because, over a 10-year period, the company is likely to have experienced \none full economic cycle\u2014good & bad times; growth and recession. \nA business does not do well over a 10\u2014year period just by accident! A company which has \nperformed well over a 10-year period is most likely to have a moat. \nBut does it mean that the past performance is a guarantee of future \nperformance? \nNo, there are no guarantees because the world is experiencing a high rate of change and \ndisruption. \nBut, an excellent past performance over a long period is an indication of a competent \nManagement that can handle the ups and downs it is likely to face in the future. \nWhat else is essential to qualify as a great business worth \ninvesting in? \nIn addition to a sustainable moat and its excellent track record, one more thing is \nessential: A Respectable Management. \nBut isn\u2018t it enough to know that the management is competent? \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nNo. In addition to competence, respectable Management is a critical go-no-go \ncriterion for investing in a company. \nPromoters and top management have to pass this test with flying colors because they run \nthe company; they report the results and disclose information that is available to the public. \nSo if there are any doubts about their honesty, you should completely avoid investing in \ncompanies run by them. It is not easy to know for certain if a company is run by honest \nmanagement. \nHowever, it\u2018s wise to remember that precaution is better than cure. There is a tell-tale sign \nthat tells a good analyst that a company may not pass a rigorous \u2017respectable management\u2018 \ntest and you can read about it in how to Choose Good Stocks: Look for Trustworthy \nManagement. \n \n5. How to assess company performance and check \nif it is worth investing in? \nA wonderful business has 3 important characteristics: a Sustainable Moat, an excellent \nfinancial track record, and Respectable management. \nAn Excellent Financial Track record is a Go/No-Go criterion; companies that do not pass this \ncriterion are either not worth investing in or have an uncertain future making it a risky \ninvestment. \nBut isn\u2018t figuring out if a company has an excellent track record, very difficult? \nOne look at the big, fat, 100+ pages Annual Report with reams of data is enough to convince \nyou that this is not your cup of tea. \nBut, there is an easy and effective way to separate the investment-worthy companies from \nthe rest. \nLook at 6 financial parameters over 10 years to shortlist a wonderful company. \n1. Earnings per Share (EPS)  \n2. Net Operating Cash Flow \n3. Net Sales \n4. Book Value per Share (BVPS) \n5. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and, \n6. Debt-to-Operating Cash Flow. \nLet\u2018s see how!  \n \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nWhat is Earnings per Share? \n \nWhat is the first thing that you will look for in a company before investing? Obviously, \nwhether it is making a profit and is it consistent! \nEarnings per Share (EPS) is profits-after-tax per share (PAT divided by a number of \nshares). When you see the company\u2018s EPS over 10 years you can assess its ability to \ndeliver profits. In the long run, the price of the company stock depends on its EPS \nand how it is expected to grow. \nWhy is Net Operating Cash flow important? \nWhen a Company reports profits one would expect that money is available to \nshareholders. But what if all or some of it is required to run the operations of the business ie \nworking capital? \nNet Operating Cash Flow highlights this; it is the actual cash generated by a company from \nits business minus the net working capital required. \nSo, if a company\u2018s Operating Cash Flow is consistently lower than its reported profit then it \ndoes not generate positive cash flow and hence it should not make it on your shortlist. \nWhy is Net Sales important? Does size matter? \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nWhile Net Sales tell us how large the company is unless we know its market share it is not \nvery useful. \nHowever, what is important is whether the sales have grown consistently at a healthy rate. \nThis tells us whether the Company can increase its profits by selling more and more every \nyear. \nWhat sales growth rates would be considered healthy? \nSales can grow with growth in volume or price increases; preferably both. Growth in volume \nshould keep pace with growth in demand for the category e.g. if demand for paint is growing \nat 6% then that is the minimum growth rate required to maintain market share is 6%. \nSecondly, prices should reflect the effect of inflation. Only when the total cost increase is \npassed on to consumers will a company maintains its profitability. \nSo if the paint company encounters an inflation rate of 4% then its net sales must grow at a \nminimum rate of 6+4=10% to be called a healthy growth rate. \nWhen company sales grow year after year profitably, it indicates that it has a sustainable \nmoat. \nHow do we know if a company is investing in ensuring future \ngrowth? \n \nTo increase their sales in the long run, companies need to invest; expand their capacity, \nintroduce new products, etc. So they plow back some or all of the profits back into the \ncompany. \nBook Value per Share, BVPS will tell you how much a company is investing in itself. But \nyou need to check if the company is utilizing the increased capital efficiently. \nHow do we know if the company is using capital efficiently? \nCompanies, in the most basic sense, are money-using and money-making machines. How \ndo you rate a machine? Simple, look at what it produces in relation to what it uses i.e. \nefficiency. Companies produce profits using the capital invested (both equity and debt). \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nHence, to know the efficiency with which a company uses its capital, look at Return on \nCapital Employed (ROCE pronounced roce). \nA ROCE of 15% means that the company generates a return of 15% on the total \ncapital is employed. \nBut what determines whether the ROCE reported is good enough? \n \nCommon sense tells us that ROCE should be higher than the cost incurred by the company \nto get the capital. \nThe two sources of capital, equity and debt come at different costs; equity is more expensive \nthan debt. \nBoth come at different costs for different companies. This is represented by a Weighted \nAverage Cost of Capital, WACC (pronounced wack). \nSimply put large, consistently profitable companies have a lower WACC than a small \ncompany with an inconsistent track record. \nThe difference; ROCE minus WACC tells us if the company is indeed generating a positive \nexcess return over its cost of capital. So 15% ROCE is good if WACC is 12%. \nBut it\u2018s bad if WACC is 16%. See our blog on Wealth Creation Index to understand why this \nis something every savvy investor should understand. \nDebt is cheaper than equity, then why is high debt a problem? \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nWhen a company borrows money, it should be able to repay it i.e. interest and the instalment \nof the principal amount, without serious difficulty over a reasonable period of time. \nDebt-to-Operating Cash Flow tells you the number of years in which a company will be \nable to repay its debt out of its cash generation from business operations. \nWhen this ratio is high it means that the company will take a long time to pay off its debts \nand hence will pay a large portion of the company profits towards this, leaving less for \nshareholders. \nAnd very importantly, in case of any challenges e.g. economic slowdown, worker strike, etc. \nCompanies with high debt-to-Operating Cash flow may face a crisis of default, the one thing \nthat can send the stock price crashing. A ratio of less than 3 is considered acceptable. \nCompanies that meet the following criteria over a 10 year period are certainly the \nmost investment-worthy: \n\uf0b7 \nHave grown their EPS, Net Sales and BVPS by 12%+ year-on-year, \n\uf0b7 \nhave a ROCE of over 13% every year; and a positive Wealth Creation Index \n\uf0b7 \nAbility to pay off its debt in less than 3 years i.e. a Debt \u2013to -Operating Cash Flow \nratio of 3 or less. \nSo, where do you find these 6 Financial Parameters in one place and in an easy-to-\nunderstand manner? \nAt MoneyWorks4me, with our simple, color-coded and powerful tool\u201410 YEAR X-\nRAY!

What is the right price to buy a stock? \nIn stock investing the price is always known and always changing and there are many \nbuyers and sellers at a price. Shopping in such a market can be very daunting. \nThe human mind solves the discomfort by resorting to a comparison. \nThe common anchors used for comparisons are 52-week high and low, Price/Earnings, \nPrice/Book Value. But these are poor anchors and can lead to wrong decisions\u2026see our \nblogs on Myths. \nWhat is a better anchor for assessing the price of a stock? \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n \nA better anchor for assessing whether a stock is available at the right price is its Intrinsic \nValue. \nIntrinsic value essentially means value based on things the company has that generate \nvalue e.g. cash flows or the replacement cost of all its value-generating assets, etc. \nIt does not depend on things external to the company. However, this is quite difficult to \nassess very accurately and hence there can be only estimates. \nHow does one get an estimate of a stock\u2018s Intrinsic Value? \nThere are different methods that work in different situations. Since we are assessing a listed \ncompany i.e. an established company not a start-up, the most relevant method is \nthe Discounted Cash Flow, DCF method. \nThis method considers the value of all the cash flows the company can generate to arrive at \nits Intrinsic Value. \nHow does the DCF method work? \n \nIf you were to buy the whole company what price should you rationally pay for it? You \nwould look at the cash it would be able to give you every year and add it up. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nBut you can\u2018t simply add up cash generated in different years because Rs 100 today is not \nthe same as Rs 100 one, two or three years later. \nSo you have to reduce the value of the cash generated in the future years by a factor to \nmake it equivalent to its value today or its present value. \nThis is the money you earn while you own the company. And suppose you decide to sell it \nafter a fairly long time you would get some money for it based on what is called terminal \nvalue. \nNow all this depends on the company\u2018s ability to generate cash flows or simply profits and \nhence is its intrinsic value. \nIf you divided this by the number of shares you would get the Intrinsic Value of a share of \nthat company. \nBut a retail investor buys a stock, not the company so how do you \napply the DCF method? \nThe concept is very similar. Cash flow in the case of owning a stock is the dividends that \ninvestors earn and the terminal value is the price at which you sell the stock in the future. \nMoneyworks4e Equity Analysts generate estimates of the growth in EPS of the company \nand the likely PE ratio one can expect in the future say 5 years. EPS X PE (or P/EPS) gives \nan estimate of the value of the stock at the end of the holding period. \nNow discount all future cash flows at the expected rate of return that the investor should get \nand you arrive at the MRP, the price that matched the value of the stock. \n \n7. What is different about the way MoneyWorks4me \narrives at the MRP of a stock? \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nWe look at a holding period of 5 years to calculate every stock\u2018s fair value. This helps \nus reduce the regency bias- not being euphoric because recent results are excellent and not \npessimistic because of recent problems which may be short term. \nWe are also not biased by what PE the market is currently paying for the stock which is \nusually influenced by demand and supply of the stock. \nWe use the PE that the stock deserves based on its sector, peers, growth rates and \nhistorical averages. PE is used for the terminal value computation i.e. after 5 years. \nWe differentiate the expected returns from stocks based on the strength of the company i.e. \nIt is lower for strong bluechip companies and higher for others. \nMRP is not the same as the Target Price over 12 months, mentioned in various reports \nwhich tend to skew the decision in favor of buying stocks that are likely to perform in the \nshort term. \nSince stock investing must have a long term perspective-min 5 years, the MRP is a better \nanchor for investing decisions. \nBut how do we use the MRP anchor to make good decisions? \nMoneyworks4me MRP is the fair and full value of a stock; the maximum price one can pay to \nget the expected returns. However, at MRP we do not have the desired Margin of Safety \n(MOS). \nWhat is the Margin of Safety in stocks? \n \nWhenever engineers build something, the first design it using all their engineering \nknowledge to the available information and then they apply a factor by which they over-\nspecify it. \nSo if a bridge has to withstand a maximum load of 100 tons, they design it for 125 tons to \ntake care of any eventuality they haven\u2018t thought of. \n\u2015The Value Investing Guru\u2014Benjamin Graham introduced the same concept-\nmargin of safety in investing.\u2016 \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nThink of it as if you go to the market and there is a sale going on some of the items i.e. the \nseller is offering a discount on the MRP. So if there is a discount of 20% on the MRP, you \nget the item at 80% of the MRP. MOS works the same way. \nSo the price you would be willing to pay the, \n\u2015Discounted Price = MRP \u2013 Margin of Safety%\u2016 \nWhy do you need a MOS when investing in stocks? \n \nValuation of a company-stock is done by Equity Analyst trained in using different techniques \nbased on pretty sound theory. \nHowever, Analysts are required to make some projections about the company\u2018s performance \nin the future and/or some assumptions. However, no one can predict the future with \ncertainty. \nWhen you buy a stock at its MRP, you can get returns at the expected rate of return e.g. \n15% in the long term. But if the things don\u2018t pan out as expected, one may end up earning \nlower returns. \nThis could have an adverse impact on you not being able to provide for your goals. But if you \nbuy at its Discount Price with the MOS of say 20%, then there is a good chance you will get \n15% or maybe even slightly more. \nIn short, MOS is like a helmet while riding a bike. When your son or daughter starts riding a \ntwo-wheeler, don\u2018t you always insist on them wearing a helmet? You do right; else you worry \nabout them all the time they are out. \nBut what should be the Margin of Safety? \n \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n \n \nBenjamin Graham\u2019s answer was 50%. \nWarren Buffett has said,\u2018 it\u2018s far better to buy a wonderful company at a fair price than a fair \ncompany at a wonderful price. \nSo we should be willing to buy company-stocks that we consider wonderful at the Fair price \nor MRP without insisting on an MOS. \nSo the MOS can range from 0% to 50%?  \nYes and that\u2018s understandable. Some companies have a more predictable business and \nperform within a narrow band, thus the margin of error when valuing them is low. \nThese are companies that operate in categories that are large, have strong market shares \nthat they can retain or grow, have pricing power, low/no debt, non-cyclical business. The \nperformance of others can fluctuate a lot more. \nWe could consider buying companies at fair prices if they have a superior past track record, \nthe longevity of growth and competitive edge to grow profitability. \nThe margin of safety in such companies comes from strong execution and visibility of \ngrowth. \nAt times when markets have run up and nothing is available at a discounted price, we would \nprefer such companies and invest a portion of our portfolio in them. \nThese companies are likely to keep compounding over the long term and generate good \nshareholder value even if we don\u2018t buy them at a discounted price. \nSo, does the market give you opportunities to buy good company stocks at a low \nprice? \nYes, it does! In reality, there are times, the market tends to over-react and undervalues a \nfundamentally strong company, probably because it is facing tough times right now or maybe \ndue to some negative rumour, or maybe just out of favor, etc. \nBut in the long-term, it\u2018s the stock price will appreciate rationally based on its earning \ncapacity. If we stay true to investing with a long-term perspective you can take advantage of \nsuch opportunities. \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n8. When to sell a stock? Use these 2 guiding \nprinciples \nKnowing when to sell is one of the toughest decisions. It gets even more complicated by our \nemotions. If your stock price is up greed and/or ego usually takes over and you want an \neven-higher price. \nIf the stock is below your buy price you may start fearing it will fall further and want to sell \nand get out. You need to prevent your emotions from dictating the decisions you take. \nAnd for that, you need to know when is right to sell a stock \nHow do we know when is it right to sell a stock? \n \nWe prefer to buy a wonderful business and hold onto them for a long time. \nBut things change at various levels: company, sector, economy, globally that impact the \nperformance of a company and finally the market price always changes. \nSo we need some guiding principles about when to sell. \nHere are two that will help you: \nGuiding Principle No 1: When a company doesn\u2018t seem to be the wonderful \nbusiness you thought it was, you should decide to exit or reduce your holding. \nExamine the data you have that convinced you about this. Whether you wait for a price or \nnot depends on what has led to the changed status. \nRemember we bought based on the data and information we had and when we find new \ndata that tells us otherwise, it is prudent to act on it and not deny or discredit the data. \nIn some cases, you may have to sell it at a loss, but it\u2018s better to bite the bullet early. \nGuiding Principle No 2: When the market price has run up so high that the \nstock will give poor/low returns over the next few years then we should \nconsider booking some profits. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nWe know that in the long run the market will act as a weighing machine and the price will be \nmore aligned to the company\u2018s fundamentals. \nSo if a stock\u2018s price has already gone up way above its fair price now, then holding on to the \nstock means you run the risk of low returns going forward and of a sharp price correction if \nthere is an adverse event. \nIt is prudent to sell and book some/all the profit and reinvest in something that will give \nreturns. \nIs there a simple way of estimating the right time to sell? \n \nYes. Moneyworks4me MRP is the fair price of a stock which is estimated based on \ndelivering a certain expected return. When the prices are above MRP you are likely to get \nlower than expected returns. \nWe have made it simpler to communicate to users the right time to sell by introducing Upside \nPotential. This is the potential return (CAGR) over 3 years that we expect from the current \nstock price. \nIf the stock is available at its MRP the Upside Potential is the expected returns used for \narriving at its MRP e.g. 13%. \nWe have simplified it further by providing Upside Potential in 4 buckets: less than 6%, 6-\n10%, 10-15%, and more than 15%. \nHow to use the Upside Potential to take decisions to sell? \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n \nVery simply put the best stocks can be held even when the upside potential reduces below \n6% albeit some reduction in holding may be a sensible thing to do. \nOther stocks one can be trimmed when it is in the 6-10% bucket and exited fully once it \ncomes in the less than 6% bucket. \nHowever, it is important to remember that everything is pretty dynamic, prices rise and fall in \nthe short term independent of the fair price, MRP of the stock and we do raise the MRP of \nstocks based on performance. \nOnce we are convinced about trimming or exiting a stock we place it in the \u2017Sell Zone\u2018 and \nthis enables our subscribers to make better decisions. \nSimilarly, we place stocks in the \u2017Buy Zone\u2018 to enable our subscribers to make better buying \ndecisions. \n \n9. How do you build a stock portfolio that helps you \nmeet your financial goals? \nYou invest to meet your financial goals; earning high returns helps you reach there faster. \nBut you need to remember that your goal is the dog and high returns the tail. \nAnd as the saying goes, you must not let the tail wag the dog. \nFar too often people forget this and chase higher returns without paying heed to risks. \nInvesting is all about the future and the future is always uncertain. This means you are \nalways exposed to risk. \nYou cannot eliminate risk but you can and must manage it. \nHow do you manage risk in investing? \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n \nDiscipline and Diversification are two effective tools that help you do this. While luckily both \nare free, it does not mean we use it well. \nWe have seen a large number of portfolios and it\u2018s obvious that most of us could do better \non both these fronts. \nDiscipline is what prevents you from letting your emotions drive your investment decisions. \nBut discipline to do what; discipline to follow a framework of decision making; what to buy, at \nwhat price to buy, etc. \n \nOur entire site is built on a framework of fundamental investing, it has a strong process. \nIt does not mean that it will work wonders all the time, but following the process consistently \nis essential to meet your financial goals through investing and also earning high returns. \nDiversification is the answer to the third essential question you need to ask before \ninvesting; \u2017How much of each stock should you own?\u2018 \nThe answer is managing a diversified portfolio of not more than 20 stocks. \nDiversification ensures you don\u2018t put all the eggs in one basket. So how do you do this? \nBut first, why 20 stocks? \nHow many stocks ensure sufficient diversification? \n \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nStatisticians have studied the volatility of a portfolio with varying numbers of stocks from 2 to \n500 versus the market. \nThey concluded that volatility reduces to a large extent when a portfolio has 16 stocks but \nhaving more than 32 stocks doesn\u2018t materially reduce the volatility any further. \nSo we believe investors must hold somewhere in the range of 20 stocks to get the maximum \npossible benefit of diversification. \n \nShould stocks be bought equally in the portfolio? \n \nEven though we eliminate the stocks that are red i.e. not investment-worthy, not all \ncompanies that make the shortlist are equally attractive. \nSome stocks deserve higher allocation than others especially the ones with a strong and \nconsistent performance capability, the ones with a strong sustainable moat. \nSome companies\u2018 earnings are likely to be lumpy due to the cyclical nature of the business. \nIt\u2018s prudent to commit a lower amount to such stocks. \nAt MoneyWorks4me, we recommend shortlisted stocks to be bought in three portfolio \nweightage categories viz 7%-5%-3%. \nWe recommend 7% of portfolio weightage to superior quality and sustainable profitable \ngrowth companies. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nWe invest 5% in most above-average companies with robust cash flows and consistent \nROEs, while good businesses but cyclical, asset-based business and leveraged companies \nfall in a 3% bucket. \nUsing this allocation strategy, the volatility of the portfolio is likely to be lower than the market \nas a portfolio is skewed towards stable business and volatile companies are smaller portions \nof the portfolio. \nAs you can infer with this allocation strategy a portfolio can have a maximum of 33 \nstocks and a minimum of 14 stocks. In all likelihood 20-25 stock is what your portfolio \nwill have when you follow this process. \nAs you can see when you have space for about 20 stocks only you should not be tempted to \ninclude mediocre and risky companies in your portfolio. \nCan we reduce risk further? \n \nYes, through better portfolio management. Every good portfolio manager follows some \nthumb rules to avoid the risk that arises due to the composition of the portfolio. \nThere are three such risks and good thumb-rules that you should follow: \n1. Sector Exposure Risk: \nInvest less than 25% in any one sector; don\u2018t exceed it. This ensures you are not over-\nexposed to a particular sector and in case that sector faces certain challenges you can \nhandle the turbulence better. \nOf-course you need to have selected strong companies within the sector. \n2. Stock Concentration Risk: \nOur 7-5-3% portfolio weightage method ensures you are not overexposed to any particular \ncompany-stock. \nEven if the stock runs up faster than others, avoid exceeding twice the original allocation i.e. \n14-10-6% by booking some profits. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n3. Market Cap Risk: \nSmall cap companies with a good business model grow faster, which leads to a large rise in \ntheir stock prices and results in very good returns. Hence they may find a place in your \nportfolio. \nHowever, their performance could be strongly affected by the economic downturn, \ncommodity prices, lack of resources, etc. \nThere is the additional risk of not knowing enough about the company since small caps are \nnot studied as closely as large caps. \nThis exposes you to the risk of poor governance and fraud. If you have a moderate risk \nprofile, you should invest not more than 20% in small caps. \nThis will enable you to participate in the potential for growth from small caps while limiting \nthe market capitalization risk to your overall portfolio. \nSimultaneously, invest 60% in large caps with low volatility and steady returns. \nSo how should one build the position of each stock in the portfolio? Should one buy the \nmaximum allocation in one go? \nWe all suffer buyer\u2018s remorse i.e. after we buy if the prices go down we wish we had waited \nand if the prices go up we wish we had bought more. \nThe same thing happens to us when we sell a stock. Our ability to handle this \nremorse makes us a better investor. \nRead further to know how a process for buying and selling can help reduce remorse and \nmake you a better investor? \n \n10. How a process for buying and selling can help \nreduce remorse and make you a better investor? \nAs mentioned in \u2017How to build a portfolio?\u2018 you need to have a maximum allocation to every \nstock that you buy. At MoneyWorks4me this ranges from 3 to 7%. \nNow the question that needs answering is how do you go about buying this? Do I buy 100% \nof the required allocation say 7% in one go at one price? \nNo, this has many downsides both in terms of returns performance but more importantly in \ngenerating remorse which can be counter-productive. \nIt\u2018s better to buy and sell in instalments or tranches. \nWhy is buying in tranches a better process? \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \n \nAt Moneyworks4me we recommend using the stock\u2018s MRP-fair price as an anchor for buying \ndecisions. We buy at a discount from the MRP based on the MOS. \nThese serve as very good guideposts when making decisions. But there are no guarantees \nwhen the market will offer the stock at the exact MOS, if at all. So as a process we buy in \ntranches. \nThe method is simply put, is that if the price of a stock falls and you execute all the buying \ntranches/instalments your average buy price will be close to the intended buy price. \nSuppose you intend to buy 300 units of a stock at Rs. 100. You now plan your buying in 3 \nequal instalments at Rs. 107, 100 and 93. Your average buy price would still be Rs. 100. \nHowever, stocks and markets don\u2018t behave in a predictable manner and we need to \ncheck how the method works under different scenarios. \n1. The market price reaches the first tranche price i.e. 107 and then rises again. Here \nyou would be happy to have bought some shares even if the price was higher than \nyour intended price. \nThis tends to happen with very good company-stocks which tend to fall below only \nmarginally below fair price if at all \n2. If the price falls below 107, you don\u2018t get stuck to the fact that you have lost some \nmoney on the first 100 shares, but wait for it to reach Rs100 and buy the next \ntranche. \nNow your average buy price is 103. The stock can then move either up or down. If it \nmoves up, your paper loss reduces or eliminated making you happy and if it \ncontinues above 103.5 you start seeing paper profits. \n3. If the price falls below Rs100, you go through the same emotions as above all the \nway to 93 when you buy the last instalment. \nNow between the stock prices of 93-107, you have used the market and stock volatility to \nbuy rather than get demotivated or paralyzed by it. \nNow if the stock is at 93, you have made a paper loss of 7% on it. But how much is it at your \nportfolio level. \nSuppose the max allocation was 7%, it would be less than 0.5% of your portfolio. You will \nunlikely to lose sleep over this one stock. \n \nwww.moneyworks4me.com \nThe process of buying in tranches preconditions the mind to accept stock price volatility and \nreduces remorse. \nOf course, the process works best when you have a reasonable correct fair price and a good \nestimate of the MOS. \nSimilarly, when selling, we recommend selling in tranches, usually two, based on the drop in \nupside potential. \nWe prefer to be fearful when the market is greedy and recommend selling partly when the \nupside potential drops below 6%. \nHaving booked some profits we can wait for a great price to fully exit the stock. If not we \nshould be comfortable to hold onto it. \nWhen we do this, the remorse of selling too early is largely diminished. \n \nIf you liked what you read and would like to put it in to practice Register at \nMoneyWorks4me.com.
