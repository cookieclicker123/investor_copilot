{"text": "For release at 2:00 p.m. EST \n \n \n \n \n \n   November 7, 2024 \n \n \n \nRecent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. \nSince earlier in the year, labor market conditions have generally eased, and the unemployment \nrate has moved up but remains low. Inflation has made progress toward the Committee\u2019s \n2 percent objective but remains somewhat elevated. \n \nThe Committee seeks to achieve maximum employment and inflation at the rate of \n2 percent over the longer run. The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment \nand inflation goals are roughly in balance. The economic outlook is uncertain, and the \nCommittee is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate. \n \nIn support of its goals, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal \nfunds rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. In considering additional \nadjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess \nincoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks. The Committee will continue \nreducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt and agency mortgage\u2011backed \nsecurities. The Committee is strongly committed to supporting maximum employment and \nreturning inflation to its 2 percent objective. \n \nIn assessing the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will continue to \nmonitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook. The Committee \nwould be prepared to adjust the stance of monetary policy as appropriate if risks emerge that \ncould impede the attainment of the Committee\u2019s goals. The Committee\u2019s assessments will take \n(more) \n-2- \ninto account a wide range of information, including readings on labor market conditions, \ninflation pressures and inflation expectations, and financial and international developments. \nVoting for the monetary policy action were Jerome H. Powell, Chair; John C. Williams, \nVice Chair; Thomas I. Barkin; Michael S. Barr; Raphael W. Bostic; Michelle W. Bowman; Lisa \nD. Cook; Mary C. Daly; Beth M. Hammack; Philip N. Jefferson; Adriana D. Kugler; and \nChristopher J. Waller. \n-0- \nAttachment \nFor media inquiries, please email media@frb.gov or call 202-452-2955. \nFor release at 2:00 p.m. EST \n \n \n \n \n         November 7, 2024 \n \nDecisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation \nThe Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance \nannounced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on November 7, 2024: \n\u2022 \nThe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted unanimously to lower the \ninterest rate paid on reserve balances to 4.65 percent, effective November 8, 2024. \n\u2022 \nAs part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to direct the Open \nMarket Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to \nexecute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following \ndomestic policy directive: \n\"Effective November 8, 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to: \no Undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate \nin a target range of 4-1/2 to 4-3/4 percent. \no Conduct standing overnight repurchase agreement operations with a minimum bid \nrate of 4.75 percent and with an aggregate operation limit of $500 billion. \no Conduct standing overnight reverse repurchase agreement operations at an \noffering rate of 4.55 percent and with a per-counterparty limit of $160 billion per \nday. \no Roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's \nholdings of Treasury securities maturing in each calendar month that exceeds a \ncap of $25 billion per month.
