The left \nvertical axis shows the profit/loss scale. The horizontal zero \nline in the middle is the break-even point, not including \ncommissions. Therefore, anything above that line indicates \nprofits, anything below it, losses. The price of the underlying \ninstrument is represented along the bottom. \u201cA,\u201d \u201cB\u201d and \u201cC\u201d \nin the diagrams indicate the strike prices. The arrows show \nthe impact of time decay on an option.\nArrows on the diagram under the heading of \u201cPattern \nEvolution\u201d indicate what impact the decay of option prices \nwith time has on the total position. The purple line reflects \nthe situation with four months left until expiration, the gold \nline the status with one month left and the green line the \nsituation at expiration.\nFor more information, \ngo to cmegroup.com/options\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLong Futures\t\n1          \nShort Futures\t\n2\nLong Synthetic Futures\t\n3\nShort Synthetic Futures\t\n4\nLong Risk Reversal\t\n5\n(AKA Squash or Combos)\nShort Risk Reversal\t\n6\n(AKA Squash or Combos)\nLong Call\t\n7\nShort Call\t\n8\nLong Put\t\n9\nShort Put\t\n10\nBull Spread\t\n11\nBear Spread\t\n12\nLong Butterfly\t\n13\nShort Butterfly\t\n14\nLong Iron Butterfly\t\n15\nShort Iron Butterfly\t\n16\nLong Straddle\t\n17\nShort Straddle\t\n18\nLong Strangle\t\n19\nShort Strangle\t\n20\nRatio Call Spread\t\n21\nRatio Put Spread\t\n22\nCall Ratio Backspread\t\n23\nPut Ratio Backspread\t\n24\nBox or Conversion\t\n25\nPattern evolution:\n1\nLONG FUTURES\nCATEGORY: Directional\nSYNTHETICS: Long call A, short put A\nA\nWhen to use: When you are bullish on the market and \nuncertain about volatility.

In general, the more out-of-the-money (higher strike) \ncalls, the more bullish the strategy. \nProfit characteristics: Profit increases as market rises. At \nexpiration, break-even point will be call option exercise price A + \nprice paid for call option. \nLoss characteristics: Loss limited to amount paid for option. \nMaximum loss realized if market ends below option exercise A. \nDecay characteristics: Position is a wasting asset. As time \npasses, value of position erodes toward expiration value.\nPattern evolution:\n8\nSHORT CALL\nCATEGORY: Directional\nSYNTHETICS: Short instrument, short put\nA\nWhen to use: When you are bearish on the market. Sell out-\nof-the-money (higher strike) calls if you are less confident the \nmarket will fall, sell at-the-money calls if you are confident the \nmarket will stagnate or fall. \nProfit characteristics: Profit limited to premium received. At \nexpiration, break-even is exercise price A + premium received. \nMaximum profit realized if market settles at or below A.\nLoss characteristics: Loss potential is open-ended. Loss \nincreases as market rises. At expiration, losses increase by one \npoint for each point market is above break-even. Because risk \nis open-ended, position must be watched closely.\nDecay characteristics: Position benefits from time decay. \nThe option seller\u2019s profit increases as option loses its time \nvalue. Maximum profit from time decay occurs if option is at-\nthe-money.\nPattern evolution:\n9\nLONG PUT\nCATEGORY: Directional\nSYNTHETICS: Short instrument, long call\nA\nWhen to use: When you are bearish to very bearish on the \nmarket. In general, the more out-of-the-money (lower strike) \nthe put option strike price, the more bearish the strategy.\nProfit characteristics: Profit increases as markets fall. At \nexpiration, break-even point will be option exercise price A \u2013 \nprice paid for option. For each point below break-even, profit \nincreases by additional point.\nLoss characteristics: Loss limited to amount paid for option. \nMaximum loss realized if market ends above option exercise A. \nDecay characteristics: Position is a wasting asset. As time \npasses, value of position erodes toward expiration value. \nPattern evolution:\n10\nSHORT PUT\nCATEGORY: Directional\nSYNTHETICS: Long instrument, short call\nA\nWhen to use: If you firmly believe the market is not going \ndown. Sell out-of-the-money (lower strike) options if you are \nonly somewhat convinced, sell at-the-money options if you are \nvery confident the market will stagnate or rise. If you doubt \nmarket will stagnate and are more bullish, sell in-the-money \noptions for maximum profit.\nProfit characteristics: Profit limited to premium received from \nput option sale. At expiration, break-even point is exercise \nprice A \u2013 premium received. Maximum profit realized if market \nsettles at or above A.\nLoss characteristics: Loss potential is open-ended. Loss \nincreases as market falls. At expiration, losses increase by one \npoint for each point market is below break-even. Because risk \nis open-ended, position must be watched closely.\nDecay characteristics: Position benefits from time decay. The \noption seller\u2019s profit increases as option loses its time value. \nMaximum profit from time decay occurs if option is at-the-\nmoney. \nPattern evolution:\n11\nBULL SPREAD\nCATEGORY: Directional\nLong call A, short call B\nLong put A, short put B\nWhen to use: If you think the market will go up, but with \nlimited upside. Good position if you want to be in the market \nbut are less confident of bullish expectations. You\u2019re in good \ncompany. This is the most popular bullish trade.\nProfit characteristics: Profit limited, reaching maximum if \nmarket ends at or above strike price B at expiration. If call-vs.-\ncall version (most common) used, break-even is at A + net cost \nof spread. If put-vs.-put version used, break-even is at B \u2013 net \npremium collected.\nLoss characteristics: What is gained by limiting profit potential \nis mainly a limit to loss if you guessed wrong on market. \nMaximum loss if market at expiration is at or below A. With \ncall-vs.-call version, maximum loss is net cost of spread.\nDecay characteristics: If market is midway between A and \nB, little if any time decay effect. If market is closer to B, time \ndecay is generally a benefit. If market is closer to A, time decay \nis generally detrimental to profitability. \nA\nB\nPattern evolution:\n12\nBEAR SPREAD\nCATEGORY: Directional\nShort put A, long put B\nShort call A, long call B\n \nWhen to use: If you think the market will go down, but with \nlimited downside. Good position if you want to be in the \nmarket but are less confident of bearish expectations. The \nmost popular position among bears because it may be entered \nas a conservative trade when uncertain about bearish stance.\nProfit characteristics: Profit limited, reaching maximum at \nexpiration if market is at or below strike price A. If put-vs.-put \nversion (most common) used, break-even is at B \u2013 net cost of \nspread. If call-vs.-call version, break-even is at A + net premium \ncollected.\nLoss characteristics: By accepting a limit on profits, you also \nachieve a limit on losses. Losses, at expiration, increase as \nmarket rises to B, where they are at a maximum. With put-vs.-\nput version, maximum loss is net cost of spread.\nDecay characteristics: If market is midway between A and \nB, little if any time decay effect. If market is closer to A, time \ndecay is generally a benefit. If market is closer to B, time decay \nis generally detrimental to profitability. \nA\nB\nPattern evolution:\n13\nLONG \nBUTTERFLY\nCATEGORY: Precision\nLong call A, short 2 calls B, long call C\nLong put A, short 2 puts B, long put C\n(Note: B \u2013 A generally is equal to C \u2013 B)\n \nWhen to use: One of the few positions which may be entered \nadvantageously in a long-term options series. Enter when, with \none month or more to go, cost of the spread is 10 percent or \nless of B \u2013 A (20 percent if a strike exists between A and B). This \nis a rule of thumb; check theoretical values.\nProfit characteristics: Maximum profit occurs if a market is at \nB at expiration. That profit would be B \u2013 A \u2013 net cost of spread. \nThis profit develops, almost totally, in the last month.\nLoss characteristics: Maximum loss, in either direction, is cost \nof spread. A very conservative trade, break-evens are at A + \ncost of spread and at C \u2013 cost of spread.\nDecay characteristics: Decay negligible until final month, \nduring which distinctive pattern of butterfly forms. Maximum \nprofit growth is at B. If you are away from (A-C) range entering \nthe last month, you may wish to liquidate position.\nA\nB\nPattern evolution:\n14\nSHORT\nBUTTERFLY\nCATEGORY: Precision\nShort call A, long 2 calls B, short call C\nShort put A, long 2 puts B, short put C \n(Note: B \u2013 A generally is equal to C \u2013 B)\n \nWhen to use: When the market is either below A or above C \nand position is overpriced with a month or so left. Or when \nonly a few weeks are left, market is near B, and you expect an \nimminent move in either direction.\nProfit characteristics: Maximum profit equals the credit at \nwhich spread is established. Occurs when market, at expiration, \nis below A or above C, thus making all options in-the-money or \nall options out-of-the-money.\nLoss characteristics: Maximum loss occurs if market is at B at \nexpiration. Amount of that loss is B \u2013 A \u2013 credit received when \nsetting up position. Break-evens are at A + initial credit and \nC \u2013 initial credit.\nDecay characteristics: Decay negligible until final month, \nduring which distinctive pattern of butterfly forms. Maximum \nloss acceleration is at B.\nA\nC\nB\nPattern evolution:\nA\nC\nB\nLONG IRON\nBUTTERFLY\nCATEGORY: Precision\nLong straddle B, short strangle at AC \nShort put A, long put B, long call B, short call C \n(Note: B \u2013 A generally is equal to C \u2013 B)\nWhen to use: When the market is either below A or above \nC and the position is underpriced with a month or so left. Or \nwhen only a few weeks are left, market is near B, and you \nexpect an imminent breakout move in either direction.\nProfit characteristics: Maximum profit equals (B \u2013 A) less \nthe net debit to create the position. Occurs when market, at \nexpiration, is below A or above C.\nLoss characteristics: Maximum loss occurs if market is at B \nat expiration. Amount of that loss is net debit to create the \nposition. Break-evens are at B + and \u2013 initial debit.\nDecay characteristics: Decay negligible until final month, \nduring which distinctive pattern of butterfly forms. Maximum \nloss is at B. If you are away from (A-C) range entering last \nmonth, you may wish to hold the position.\n15\nPattern evolution:\n16\nSHORT IRON \nBUTTERFLY\nA\nC\nB\nCATEGORY: Precision\nShort 1 call and 1 put at B, buy 1 put at A, buy 1 call at C \nor sell straddle at strike price B and buy strangle at AC \nfor protection \n(Note: B \u2013 A generally is equal to C \u2013 B)\nWhen to use: Enter when the Short Iron Butterfly\u2019s net credit is \n80 percent or more of C \u2013 A, and you anticipate a prolonged \nperiod of relative price stability where the underlying will be \nnear the mid-point of the C \u2013 A range close to expiration. This \nis a rule of thumb; check theoretical values.\nProfit characteristics: Maximum profit occurs if a market \nis at B at expiration. Profit would be equal to short straddle \npremium minus long strangle premium. This profit develops, \nalmost totally, in the last month.\nLoss characteristics: Maximum loss, in either direction, net \npremium collected minus (B-A). This is a very conservative \ntrade, break-evens are at B + and \u2013 net premium collected.\nDecay characteristics: Decay negligible until final month, \nduring which distinctive pattern of butterfly forms. Maximum \nprofit growth is at B. If you are away from (A-C) range entering \nthe last month, you may wish to liquidate position. \nPattern evolution:\n17\nLONG \nSTRADDLE\nCATEGORY: Precision \nLong call A, long put A\nSYNTHETICS: Long 2 calls A, short instrument\nLong 2 puts A, long instrument\n(All done to initial delta neutrality. A delta neutral spread \nis a spread established as a neutral position by using \nthe deltas of the options involved. The neutral ratio is \ndetermined by dividing the delta of the purchased option \nby the delta of the written option)\nWhen to use: If market is near A and you expect it to start \nmoving but are not sure which way. Especially good position if \nmarket has been quiet, then starts to zigzag sharply, signaling \npotential eruption.\nProfit characteristics: Profit open-ended in either direction. \nAt expiration, break-even is at A, +/\u2013 cost of spread. However, \nposition is seldom held to expiration because of increasing time \ndecay with passage of time.\nLoss characteristics: Loss limited to the cost of spread. \nMaximum loss occurs if market is at A at expiration.\nDecay characteristics: Time decay accelerates as options \napproach expiration. Position is generally liquidated well before \nexpiration.\nA\nPattern evolution:\n18\nSHORT \nSTRADDLE\nCATEGORY: Precision\nShort call A, short put A\nSYNTHETICS: Short 2 calls A, long instrument \nShort 2 puts A, short instrument \n(All done to initial delta neutrality)\nWhen to use: If market is near A and you expect market is \nstagnating. Because you are short options, you reap profits as \nthey decay \u2014 as long as market remains near A.\nProfit characteristics: Profit maximized if market, at expiration, \nis at A. In call-put scenario (most common), maximum profit is \nequal to the credit from establishing position; break-even is A \n+/\u2013 total credit.\nLoss characteristics: Loss potential open-ended in either \ndirection. Position, therefore, must be closely monitored \nand readjusted to delta neutral if market begins to drift away \nfrom A.\nDecay characteristics: Because you are only short options, you \npick up time-value decay at an increasing rate as expiration \napproaches. Time decay is maximized if market is near A.\nA\nPattern evolution:\n19\nLONG \nSTRANGLE\nCATEGORY: Precision\nLong put A, long call B\n(Generally done to initial delta neutrality)\nWhen to use: If market is within or near (A-B) range and \nhas been stagnant. If market explodes either way, you make \nmoney; if market continues to stagnate, you lose less than \nwith a long straddle. Also useful if implied volatility is expected \nto increase.\nProfit characteristics: Profit open-ended in either direction. \nBreak-even levels are at A \u2013 cost of spread and B + cost of \nspread. However, spread is usually not held to expiration.\nLoss characteristics: Loss limited. Loss is equal to net cost \nof position. Maximum loss occurs if, at expiration, market is \nbetween A and B.\nDecay characteristics: Decay accelerates as options approach \nexpiration but not as rapidly as with long straddle. To avoid \nlargest part of decay, the position is normally liquidated prior \nto expiration.\nA\nB\nPattern evolution:\n20\nSHORT \nSTRANGLE\nCATEGORY: Precision\nShort put A, short call B \n(All done to initial delta neutrality)\nWhen to use: If market is within or near (A-B) range and, \nthough active, is quieting down. If market goes into stagnation, \nyou make money; if it continues to be active, you have a bit \nless risk then with a short straddle. \nProfit characteristics: Maximum profit equals option premium \ncollected. Maximum profit realized if market, at expiration, is \nbetween A and B.\nLoss characteristics: At expiration, losses occur only if market \nis above B + option premium collected (for put-call) or below A \n\u2013 that amount. Potential loss is open-ended. Although less risky \nthan short straddle, position is risky. \nDecay characteristics: Because you are short options, time \nvalue decays at an increasing rate as the option expiration \ndate approaches; maximized if market is within (A-B) range.\nA\nB\nPattern evolution:\n21\nRATIO CALL \nSPREAD\nCATEGORY: Precision\nLong call A, short calls B\nFor example long 1 call @ A; short 2 calls @ B\nWhen to use: Usually entered when market is near A and user \nexpects a slight to moderate rise in market but sees a potential \nfor sell-off. One of the most common option spreads, seldom \ndone more than 1:3 (two excess shorts) because of upside risk.\nProfit characteristics: Maximum profit, is equal to B \u2013 A \u2013 net \ncost of position (for call-vs.-call version), realized if market is at \nB at expiration or B \u2013 A + net credit of position (if long option \npremium is less than premium collected from the sale of two or \nmore options).\nLoss characteristics: Loss limited on downside (to net cost of \nposition in call-vs.-call, or no loss if position established at a \ncredit) but open-ended if market rises. Rate of loss, if market \nrises beyond strike price B, is proportional to number of excess \nshorts in position.\nDecay characteristics: Depends on the net time value \npurchased or sold via this strategy. If more time value sold than \nbought, then time value decays works to the benefit of the \nholder of this strategy. \nA\nB\nPattern evolution:\n22\nRATIO PUT \nSPREAD\nCATEGORY: Precision\nLong put B, short puts A \nFor example long 1 put @ B; short 2 puts @ A\nWhen to use: Usually entered when market is near B and you \nexpect market to fall slightly to moderately, but see a potential \nfor sharp rise. One of the most common option spreads, \nseldom done more than 1:3 (two excess shorts) because of \ndownside risk.\nProfit characteristics: Maximum profit in amount of B \u2013 A \u2013 \nnet cost of position (for put-vs.-put version), realized if market \nis at A at expiration, or B \u2013 A + net credit of position (if long \noption premium is less than premium collected from the sale of \ntwo or more options).\nLoss characteristics: Loss limited on upside (to net cost of \nposition in put-vs.-put version, or no loss if position established \nat a credit) but open-ended if market falls. Rate of loss, if \nmarket falls below strike price A, is proportional to number of \nexcess shorts in position.\nDecay characteristics: Dependent on the net time value \npurchased or sold via this strategy. If more time value sold than \nbought, then time value decays work to the benefit of \nthe holder.\nA\nB\nPattern evolution:\n23\nCALL RATIO\nBACKSPREAD\nCATEGORY: Precision\nShort call A, long 2 or more calls B\nWhen to use: Normally entered when market is near B and \nshows signs of increasing activity, with greater probability \nto upside.\nProfit characteristics: Profit limited on downside (if net credit \ntaken in when position was established) but open-ended in \nrallying market.\nLoss characteristics: Maximum loss, is amount of B \u2013 A \u2013 \ninitial credit (or B \u2013 A + initial debit), realized if market is at B \nat expiration. This loss is less than for equivalent long straddle, \nthe trade-off for sacrificing profit potential on the downside.\nDecay characteristics: Dependent on the net time value \npurchased or sold via this strategy. If more time value sold than \nbought, then time value decays work to the benefit of \nthe holder.\nB\nPattern evolution:\n24\nPUT RATIO \nBACKSPREAD\nCATEGORY: Precision\nShort 1 put B, long 2 or more puts A\nWhen to use: Normally entered when market is near A and \nshows signs of increasing activity, with greater probability to \ndownside (for example, if last major move was up, followed \nby stagnation).\nProfit characteristics: Profit limited on upside (to net credit \ntaken in when position was established) but open-ended in \ncollapsing market.\nLoss characteristics: Maximum loss, is amount of B \u2013 A \u2013 initial \ncredit (or B \u2013 A + initial debit), realized if market is at A at \nexpiration. This loss is less than for the equivalent long straddle, \nthe trade-off for sacrificing profit potential on the upside.\nDecay characteristics: Dependent on the net time value \npurchased or sold via this strategy. If more time value sold \nthan bought, then time value decays work to the benefit of \nthe holder. \nA\nB\nPattern evolution:\n25\nBOX OR \nCONVERSION\nCATEGORY: Locked or arbitrage trade.\nThese spreads are referred to as \u201clocked trades\u201d because \ntheir value at expiration is totally independent of the \nprice of the underlying instrument. If you can buy them \nfor less than that value or sell them for more, you will \nmake a profit (ignoring commission costs). \nWhen to use: Occasionally, a market will get out of line \nenough to justify an initial entry into one of these positions. \nHowever, they are most commonly used to \u201clock\u201d all or part of \na portfolio by buying or selling to create the missing \u201clegs\u201d of \nthe position. These are alternatives to closing out positions at \npossibly unfavorable prices.\nLong box: Long a bull spread, long a bear spread \u2014 that is, \nlong call A, short call B, long put B, short put A.
